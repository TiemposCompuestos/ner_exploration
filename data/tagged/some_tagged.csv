lJbxx9ym2CSzT0u7Xv3JAg,"I called here on a Sunday trying to get a last minute appointment after having a bad experience somewhere else. The girl that answered the phone (Tori) accommodated me so perfectly and set me up with a last minute same day appointment because I was flying out the next morning. She did a fantastic job. So natural looking, full, and lasted along time. I always hear people say how their lashes last 3-4 weeks. When Tori does mine they last at least 5weeks. I also got them done by her in August before I went to Greece. I told her I was gonna be Gina awhile and spend a lot of time in the water she did the best job ever I seriously didn't even think about a fill until at least the 7th week.   Place is clean, girls are friendly, there is also a package on fills.   Basically all around recommended.  Thanks Tori",0
kZxFQvjgaMnAxFDkK1bfxA,"This place is ok, not as pleasant as the one we used to go to in Phoenix. There's one girl who is really short and we know so much about her because she is always talking about herself to her co-workers and will not focus on her job. She's messed up on orders a few times and it even looks like her co-workers want her to shut up. The ones who make up for the service are the older ones who usually do not mess up on orders.",1
KNVMahZH_7xDDjZz-K6lwg,"Stopped in on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, and I'm so glad we did.  We had fun browsing, as everything was very appealing and well-priced.  It's the sort of place where you see something cute that you want and you think \I can actually afford this!\""  A rare treat.  They were also offering tastings of their sparkling wines, which was really fun.  $1 got me a little mini-glass of bubbly, and they had some strawberries, chocolate, crackers, and cheese for snacking as well!  I bought two bottles of inexpensive wine that were recommended by the owners.  Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'd love to go back to Tremont and return to this store.  It's a really pleasant place to be, and I think there are some great, affordable finds - both for wine and home decor.  Also - they have an adorable dog!  Even more reason to check it out!""",0
D1PhUlkQA1ZsVe9Cx4yqOw,"I really enjoyed Jodi from start to finish.   I first filled out the contact information portion on the placenta lady website . Then she emailed me and we arranged a day and time for us to talk on the phone. Once we spoke oon the phone, I felt very reassured about my decision.  After delivery, I texted her. She came over to my home 2 days after I was discharged. She was on time, professional,  and knew exactly what she  was doing. The best part, even after doing research on this, was being educated on postpartum placental consumption. My entire family enjoyed being educated on the topic as to why I chose to do this.  Jodi is like the perfect spokesperson! And she offers military discount as well. This was my first pregnancy so I can't really compare it and say I felt the difference from a previous pregnancy, BUT what I can say is  that I truly believe this process assisted in my hormonal balance and getting back to My normal routine naturally quicker.  Thank you Jodi !!!!!!!",0
Kx7DTzbfY4K-uYJKTibesg,"We've gotten delivery from them about 5 times now and everything has been just stellar.  Food arrives within 45 mins, is piping hot, the portions are HUGE, and everything is better than I would expect, every time.  Really surprising how well their Thai food is seasoned, food isn't too greasy, they aren't afraid to kick the heat up a bit, and know how to make every part of the dish taste good, from the rice, to the veggies to the proteins.  Great stuff, highly recommend. I wake up at nights now craving their <dish>curry rice</dish>.",1
hray1YExFpLjorP2HAuusg,"I can't believe I have forgetten about this place, as I have not been here in awhile.  This is an A-OK lunch place and take home baked goods place, even though I have never taken home any \baked goods.\"" They look very tempting though....  If you love the Stetson chopped salad from cowboy ciao, then you will like their <dish>Salmon River salad</dish> which is basically the same thing minus the tomato's and black currants. It was pretty comparable- the salmon was a little different like a cooked smoked salmon but still was pretty mouth watering. I think its the buttermilk dressing that does it.  They always have good <dish>soup</dish> as well......not always a vegetarian one though. But given the name I guess this isn't really the place for vegetarians. I am not sure but do they even sell ham here??"""
KIhHU87UJMw9MMLEoVxkdQ,"Nella's vast selection and below-average prices had me seriously excited when I walked in for what should have been the first purchase of many--a beautiful, 10-inch frying pan that turned out to be defective (it did not sit flat on my ceramic burner). When I returned with pan and receipt in hand, the store would not replace it but instead directed me to the manufacturer in California--a slow and expensive non-solution to my problem. I live walking distance from Nella and had looked forward to updating my kitchen gear there. I'd rather take my business to a store that values customer loyalty and stands behind what it sells.",0
1fi_d9uqLAYLcsyCiHYCSw,This daycare is top notch! I've trusted KRK with the care of my boys for 5 years now and don't regret a minute of it.  The education is wonderful. My three year old Is already writing his name.  Long hours and monthly parent-night out events.  Check them out!,0
7RTwUpuPFnIHPoTmWJpWhQ,"Really, I would give this place 3.5 stars. It is a great, relaxing place to spend a cool day. DO NOT go when it is hot - you will be miserable and so are the animals. Overall, this is a pretty standard, older zoo. What distinguishes it, though, is the amazing desert backdrops. The best areas of the zoo are those that reflect the local landscape, especially the big horn sheep area dramatically set against Papago Peak.   As an aside, the <dish>kettle corn</dish> made on site is really good as well. If you want a salty-sweet snack, this is the way to go.",0
sKIAHIGW0viQGFAMGgQ3Rg,"I've been on a poke fix lately, so when my coworkers told us a shop close to work started serving it, I jumped at the chance to join them.   Like most shops on Queen East, the shop is small. A very mom and pop, family feel. We went during <occasion>lunch</occasion>, and it was quiet for a Friday afternoon.  I got the <dish>butterfish poke bowl</dish>. It came with butterfish, cucumber, rice and taro chips. The ingredients were fresh, but the toppings lacked.  For the price I would have paid at other shops, the portion size was small, and the \included\"" options were very limited. You could get more toppings, but I have a hard time paying close to $15 for lunch and leaving hungry.   Probably won't come here for poke again, but their sushi menu did look decent.""",1
HwHXLMm9UF0XunRETPBklQ,"Loved my experience at Black Sheep.  It was my first visit and Stephanie really cared about my lifestyle and need for low maintenance, but stylish, hair care.  Thank you, Stephanie! I must also mention that I admire the environmental commitment of Black Sheep.  Ask about what they do with salon waste!  Kudos!",0
xsRufP3c3AQv_FUdMN1hGA,"It was my first time there, but they were polite, honest, forthcoming, and very knowledgeable about what I was searching for. Even though what I needed was out of stock, they went out of their way to show me exactly what the price would be from start to finish and were able to give the same online discount I had hoped for. Everything was very straight-forward and an easy ordering process step-by-step. If not for having to wait a week, I would have given 5 stars here.  They were able to order what wasn't in stock, told me exactly when it would be available, and called me the day it arrived to let me know. I've been to the range a few times with what I bought and it's been perfect for me ever since.  I was impressed with their courtesy and professionalism, and even though I sometimes shop with others, they are good people and I would gladly buy from their store again.",0
jgL2zzUVE7QJLVFXzmh6FQ,"I have been looking for a groomer that both my and I trust completely. Tammy is that groomer. My dog is old with failing eyesight, this causes him to be fearful at times especially in new situations. Tammy worked as a vet tech for many years prior to grooming and her kind nonthreatening manner put my boy at ease right away. She got him done quickly and called before he was finished, so I could be there to pick him up as soon as he was done, avoiding crate time. We will be using Tammy for all our grooming needs from now on!",0
f0X3jm4H4pfBT_eZeneqoQ,"I am visiting the area to see a friend and have been going to this Walgreens to pick up little things since it is close by. I'm so surprised with how the staff treats me, I feel like I'm back home. I don't know any names but the man that stands at the door with spiky hair and the woman that was working the cosmetic counter with dark hair were so nice. It actually makes me pick going there over Target which is right next to it for the little things I need. Always enjoy being treated nicely and a good atmosphere, good job on the hiring Walgreens!",0
8KICEzPzQIApPxlzX06OLA,"So I went in for my appointment... this was my final one and if the salon messed this one up, I wasn't coming back, gift certificate or no gift certificate.   I was greeted immediately  and offered champagne or a mimosa, then taken to a back room to relax. My masseuse was excellent, she was young, knew what she was doing and we had a great conversation throughout the massage session. Then came my facial and she was also awesome. She explained what she wanted to do, asked my concerns and went straight to work. My face still feels great!   At check out, I did tip and was offered 2 $15 off coupons to come back. I may consider it, but we'll see! They did redeem themselves after my 2 horrible first experiences.",0
9ZTU1RvvTj-n1PKII0y7cg,"I have to say I am very disappointed with my recent purchases at Chalmers. I bought two custom wedding bands. After my proposal, we took one of the rings back to have it re-sized. I was surprised to find that they hadn't recorded any information about my purchase other than a first name and what they charged my card. They didn't record my address, my full name or telephone number in their system. I had to prove it was me that purchased the rings. I expect this kind of service at a mall store. When I picked up the ring after it was re-sized; the design of the ring was completely altered. Again, at a high end store that advertises themselves as being the custom jewelry store, I expected that the designer would remember what the ring looked like before the re-sizing. It took several unsuccessful attempts to correct the ring. We are both very unhappy and stuck with rings we do not like. This is very sad when I paid almost $4000 for two custom designed rings and received less than mall jewelry store service and attention. I have purchased from other high end stores in Madison. Chalmer's is clearly behind on customer service and commitment to their customer's.",0
_QKiaaIojhi3359x6EC9dw,"I am a british citizen. And I allowed my UK passport to elapse for over 30 years with 2 name changes... from 2 separate marriages.  I was refused 2wice while doing this alone, not to mention the costs of filing fees and such.  I came across this law firm quite per chance, and BONNIE who scooped me up started an incredible journey with me which got me a passport secured and in time but beyond this, showed me a level of professionalism, skills set, emotional abilities to calm me down, during times when I was too tired to have to resubmit yet another form, or marriage decree/divorce decree.... w/out her I would never have done this. Truly!  She even sent away for my b/certificate so that I did not have to make that extra step.   She provided me with emotional guidance, and allowed this process to be far easier by taking on way more than her fair share. She never made me feel incompentent (while I am, completely so from head to toe), she allowed me to believe in a process that had become quite impossible to love, and she made it all seems quite seamless. I have no words to describe and tell all of you out there seeking for any immigration help, how lovely, amazing, effective and powerful this Bonnie is.  Rada I have to say was the one who took my call (many months ago) and suggested that I work with Bonnie.  Rada, too, showed me in the first instance, that she too, had kindness and patience... and above all, they all seem to love what they and are GOOD at it.  THAT is what makes this special!  In short, Bonnie will make the impossible happen, she is funny, will call you back, will find the documents you need, will involve herself in ways allowing the client to not take this all on and will give you the confidence to have you see that the yield will always be successful, given her power house ways and extraordinary commitment to her clients.  Well done Bonnie - to whomever hired her, take care of her. I am in my 50's and have been in the professional arena for years now. I once was an immigration paralegal here in the States... I have never worked or met anyone who has that degree of empathy, understanding, kindness and skills set that will leave anyone working with her, breathless with joy and so grateful to have met her.  She restores faith for those who have lost faith in humanity. She is ONE special magical piece to the Immigroup.  THANK YOU BONNIE!!!  I hope you are well cared for.  People like you do not come around too often. I will forever be grateful to you.  You truly inspired me to be a believer and to remain committed to a process, no matter how daunting it seems.  TAKE CARE!",0
I-5qHCVwT7k_KH67-YOx3A,"Absolutely loved the <dish>sweet corn tamale cakes</dish>, great flavored. For dinner I had the <dish>crab cakes</dish> and <dish>Caesar Salad</dish>, perfect combination. And for desert, I took home a piece of <dish>banana cream cheesecake</dish>, I definitely will be returning, and I can't wait to have the <dish>sweet corn tamale cakes</dish> again!  Unfortunately I had to deduct a star cuz the hosts up front were very rude to us the the other customers waiting also. I actually felt horrible for an older lady trying to find out how much longer she had to wait. The hostess said there are other places around here if you have a problem waiting for good food.",1
pgK0mBQLth1C3DubvmWH3w,Three stars is pretty good for me. I highly recommend this place. Best <dish>buffalo chicken wrap</dish> in PGH so far (been a lot of places but I haven't tried everywhere obviously)  <dish>chicken pesto</dish> is fantastic. And hands down best ranch in PGH. For two out of three of those reasons I keep going back.  I occasionally drink there but not often because their food is fairly priced however their drinks are closer to the overpriced side.,1
YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"(4.5 stars) I was a little skeptical of the high reviews, but I can now say they are spot on. In fact, I had such an exceptional meal that I ended up eating at the bar the next night. Thus, I got to end up trying 20+ items. I knew I would like this place right off the bat when they had <dish>Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA</dish> along with great bar snacks. As others mention, you cant miss the <dish>tuns tacos</dish>, <dish>onion soup</dish>, <dish>ravioli</dish>, <dish>skirt steak</dish>, etc. One dish not mentioned yet that I loved was the <dish>scallops</dish> (never had a better cooked scallop). For such an ambitious menu, I was surprised how well executed everything was. Sure, some dishes were simple and straightforward, but others went way beyond what you would typically find in the small plate/tapas concept. Service was great with the exception of the pacing of the food, but between the extensive menu, two major conventions in town and the restaurant being a few weeks old, it is understandable. I would certainly put this on the short list of places in Las Vegas.",1

1d3nPqv_WhZMsNOB22EawA,"I have to say it like it is.  If I happen to be in the area - and I usually am not - then <restaurant>Wendy's</restaurant> is probably not my first choice, even if I am looking for something fast.  Bojangles or Chick-Fil-A will probably get the nod, and maybe even Jack-in-the-Box.  If I want something better, there are half a dozen other places.  But if I happen to end up at <restaurant>Wendy's</restaurant>, this is not a bad location.  It can be something of a challenge to get into simply because of where it is.  You can really only access it if you are headed down Sharon Amity, and that is the only way you can exit as well.  If you are going in the other direction, or on Randolph at all, you are pretty much out of luck.  That can make things challenging, and somewhat defeats the purpose of fast food, right?  In any case, assume you do get in (and by extension, that you can then get out again), the place is actually fairly clean and the staff is pretty friendly.  It is a bit dated, but the menu is typical for what you would find in a <restaurant>Wendy's</restaurant>.  Nothing special there.  It is not the new style of building, but it works well enough in a pinch.",1
QSfFgtcIrFHMs3_TVXjCLA,"If I could give a zero star rating I would.  Easily the worst experience ever.  12/24 I showed up 20 min late for my catering order, figuring all would be  ready.  There was exactly one other customer in the restaurant besides myself.  Guy at the carving counter (bald, glasses) asked me my name and that was the last I saw of him for the next 30 minutes.  No explanations, no nothing.  In short succession, the other 3 employees also disappeared in the backroom, leaving nobody in the front of the restaurant and giving me no clue what the hell was going on.  Finally after 30 minutes waiting I asked what the problem was and I was told that *I* called and changed the pickup time on my catering order.  Um, no I didn't and nobody knew I was getting it where I was delivering it, so nobody called on my behalf either.  The \supervisor\"" (African American, light skinned, black shirt/heavily stained, no name tag) makes a huge show of walking up to the table I was sitting at, looking in the catering box at the sheet for it (my order) and yelling to one of the workers across the restaurant \""YEP! 1pm!\"" and walks away, completely ignoring me.  Finally 45 min later I got my food.  The portion for catering is a joke. I called <restaurant>Boston Market</restaurant> corporate: for 5 people the <dish>turkey</dish> you get is 1lb8 oz.  24 ounces for five people. So, roughly five ounces per person.  After 40 minutes, I got 7 pieces of <dish>turkey</dish>, weighing exactly what was expected. The slices were thicker than my pinky nail and I'm sure a blind man did the carving.  Thanks to this, two people I paid for couldn't even eat.  My mistake for not realizing <restaurant>Boston Market</restaurant> was going to screw me on this to the tune of 60 bucks.  The <dish>Mac/Cheese</dish> was sour.  Not just someone made it wrong. This tasted like someone squeezed a lemon in it; completely inedible.  Considering the utter contempt I was treated with, it's not hard for me to imagine at all that somebody did exactly that to my food.  The <dish>mashed</dish> was, well, it's mashed from a box.  You can't screw those up because the bar is so low to begin with.  ALL the <dish>muffins</dish> were stale.  Every one of them was rock hard.    If this place were my only choice on earth or dogfood, I'd eat dog food.    NO way in the world I'd ever go back between the utter customer mistreat and the lousy food.  If I were the actual manager of this place, I'd have handed out pink slips for Christmas.  I'd have been totally forgiving if the place were packed but it wasn't for any of the 40 minutes they got their jollies off by making me sit and wait when they're the ones that got the time wrong to begin with.  I have a complaint lodged with Boston corporate I'm waiting for them to call me back on, and I'll keep calling until I get this resolved.  If you want your holiday catering order screwed up, this is the place to go.  If you want decent food, ready for you when you asked for it - go anywhere else but here.""",1

Food quality is very good and their <dish>水煮鱼</dish> is one of the best you can find in town.

I called in on my way home from work and asked if there was a wait if I went in right away. The lady on the phone responded, \No! Come in right away!\"". I went in and there were no technicians available, so I waited for 20 minutes for someone to take me. The lady who started doing my nails got up at least 5 times to ring people out, answer the phone, order food on the phone, and wrote the schedule for the following week (mind you, this took 10 minutes). So she would basically just keep getting up to do tasks and leave me with half-filed nails. Anyway, it took about an hour longer than it should have and I will not ever be going back. The price is reflective of the service, I guess.""",0

CuR4Xxu_aHrYD0IGGRdm5Q,"At first when h friends wanted to go to this restaurant I was skeptical. judging by the name is seemed like another over hyped, over priced, new yuppy hang out in downtown Toronto. However, after much insistence I went to the restaurant and have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.   This eating establishment is located in Toronto, surprisingly enough just South of a street named named Temperance. Which, I have to admit, is clever.  The service was very good. The servers were polite, helpful and good. They had a good list of mixed drinks. My only thing to pick on here is the fact that their beer list sucks. I mean if you want to be a serious establishment and have a bunch of beers on tap, why would you just have mass marketed beers. Is it really that hard to have some local beers? Maybe a Mill Street, or a Duggans?  The main reason why I give the restaurant a high rating is the food. They had <dish>CEVICHE</dish>!!!! I was totally excited when I saw this! <dish>Ceviche</dish> is a dish made from fresh raw fish marinated in citrus juices such as lemon or lime and spiced with chilli peppers. The citrus denatures the fish so it practically tastes cooked if done correctly. Here they served it with mangos, and it was done superbly. I really like it. They also had <dish>fish tacos</dish>, which beyond sounding like a metaphor were done really well. The <dish>tacos</dish> were BIG, and they were filled nicely, and plated well. Just by the plating of the food here, you can tell they really put some love into the food that they serve. This is a trait which definitely brings me back to restaurants, and makes me like them.",1

EhYPSOdJ1xixc1-vTy2oxA,"Nice physical facility, but this place has massive staffing issues since changing management a couple years ago. Turnover is extremely high for ages 2 and up, although it is somewhat stable for the infants and 1's.  This last time I noticed new teachers in our child's room. When I asked about it I was told there were there as part of certificate training in early childhood education. I showed up today and the teacher our daughter loved (who was exceptional good) was gone with nothing but a goodbye card. Clearly they knew she was leaving and told her not to tell us, which we know has happened in the past.  They also run on razor thin staffing margins so every now and then when someone leaves or is sick the room counts are over the legal limit. It's been better lately, but it comes and goes in streaks.  If you want consistency or experience, go somewhere else. Good teachers don't last here long. Especially since they never get raises and frequently don't even get their lunch breaks. We've complained to management (especially when they didn't have the legally-required adult supervision in rooms) and while they call back, they don't actually change anything about how they operate.  This isn't just us, I've met very few satisfied parents. Most of the kids that started with our child have moved to other schools.",0

4dXINKRDfcRt-30R9WX-vg,"Now WINTER HOURS **2-6pm at Bruce Trent Park on Wednesdays.  There is a variety of stuff but I went because I wanted FRESH PRODUCE... my review does not reflect on the other vendors at the market, solely the one produce stand I found yesterday who had a red ORGANIC veggie sign.   First of all, there was ONE produce stand! ONE in the market...   Second - Despite the \organic\"" sign, the only organic produce is on one table at the front from ANOTHER FARM!!! WHAT? The organic rainbow chard I got, had a commercial looking tag on with a lable from a DISTRIBUTING COMPANY=Pacific in Salenas CA and the farm=La Bette...  I did not see this tag at the market because it was in a plastic bag already...   Side note: once in a very awesome Whole Foods type supermarket in Berkeley called Berkeley Bowl, I saw the worker unwrapping califlowers wrapped in Earthbound Farms plastic THEN STOCKING- because some like me, don't like to buy from commercial big farms unless we reasonably don't have other options. A better option being buying from a farmer who isn't organic but doesn't spray and have confidence in their farming and product!  Anyways- The other non-organic veggies, they don't spray, if they do, its all natural, they told me. They sell organic veggies from other farm(s?- farms with distributing companies!!!)... I wasn't clear on the facts of which veggies they actually grew or have knowledge of where exactly these veggies come from, they weren't too chatty NOR ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT GIVING MUCH INFO, NO it wasn't crowded, maybe I was too inquisitive like a detective and scared them... but really, if I'm just there to buy whatever, I'll just go to Whole Foods! And they are more expensive or equal to WF prices!!! Really??? It's worth it if I am confident that it's FRESH, but I don't know... well, I am used to a real farmers market so this was NOT OK :(  Bottom line: If you can't talk to the farmers, get specifics on the products from the vendor, its not a farmers market!!! I'd recommend one of the Fresh 52 markets.  The feel is more of an OPEN AIR MARKET, like, a flea market of sorts, if you like that, then it'll be a good place maybe.""",0

ukRoBPJx5SWIEBwTmugc-w,"15-minute exercise is a fabulous place to get a dose of pampered hard work. Okay, that sounds like an oxymoron. Here's the gist of what this is all about. Work hard (weight machines, heavy loads, muscle failure in less than 90 seconds) under the watchful, caring, and supportive eye of head trainer Kirei, all done in 15 minutes.   Yes, indeed, so quick you don't work up a sweat. So hard your muscles vibrate for the rest of the day. The only 2 people in the studio are you and Kirei. I love that! Nobody else strutting around in skimpy spandex trying to look better than everyone else - as a matter of fact - there is no spandex here. You work out in your street clothes!  I use the 15-minute workout as the strength component to my triathlon training. It doesn't matter what your age or fitness level are. This workout is totally tailored to your individual needs and goals. Your results are only compared to your results. No one else matters when you are at 15-minute Exercise.",0

f2CkRAz77bXRFj2e0TgVNQ,"I had an emergency with my 2005 Jeep Liberty 4 wheel drive. It died on an exit ramp on the 215. I called my mechanic friend & got a referral to this place. I knew it was a transmission problem because it wouldn't get into 1st, 2nd or Drive gears. I spoke to Al & he told me to call a number to get my car towed to his garage & he would check out my Jeep.    The towing company arrived a while later & we got to the garage. Al explained to me that he had to have his mechanic take apart my transmission after I explained what i had done prior to that day & what the check engine lights told him. There were about 9 different codes so we both knew that there was extensive damage. Worse case scenario would be a rebuilt transmission or there could be an easy fix. He couldn't give me a approximate cost because he needed to take apart my transmission. Al said that he would try to cut costs where he could by charging less for his hourly fee or if he could find me a used transmission that worked just as good as a rebuilt one he would see about that. But, because my car had 62k miles & was a car that Jeep no longer made I knew that wasn't going to be easy. Al also explained that his company rebuilds the transmissions in house so that would save me money too. He was also nice enough to drive me to get a rental car at Budget.    A day later we talked & he gave me the bad news. It was as we feared. There was extensive damage done to my transmission. Metal had gone throughout it & it needed to be rebuilt. He called around & the only used transmission was one that had 90k miles on it. So, it was a better option to rebuild it because it would be like brand new. He also told me that when they tried to start my car, my battery had no charge. So he would check that out too & either replace or fix the problem. I put down a $500 deposit. And they started on my car with The end date being Thursday.    Al called me Thursday & told me that he had a problem. Some of the parts that were needed for my car haven't arrived so it would be either Friday or Saturday at the latest for my car to be repaired. I was a bit disappointed but, It wasn't his fault, stuff happens.   He kept me updated & on Saturday Him & the mechanic worked on my car all day till it was done. They usually stay open till noon but worked later to make sure I could get the car back. Again, Al offered  to pick me up at the rental car place for free.    He discounted the work for $500 &  put in a new battery. This guy is such a stand up guy, very honest & has a positive attitude. His customer service is exemplary. I would totally recommend him as a mechanic. In a world where auto mechanic shops are such rip off operations, this place is a breath of fresh air.",0
PRiRhKH7N07jVroXMWz_UA,"Dr. Khakwani saved my life.  True Story.  I went in to see Dr. Khakwani with what I thought was a urinary track infection.  The symptoms I experienced were the need to pee every two hours.   He immediately put me on medication but at the same time ordered blood work for diabetes and tumor marker CA-125.  Simultaneously he ordered a pelvic and trans-vaginal ultra sound.   The blood work came back within a week as negative for a tumor.  But the ultra sound showed a growth in my right ovary.  He immediately referred me to an Gynocological-Oncologist who confirmed the growth as a cancerous tumor.  Within two weeks of seeing Dr. Khakwani, I was in surgery.  My cancer is a very rare form of Ovarian Cancer and is usually found in later stages because the symptoms are hard to diagnose.  Thanks to Dr. Khakwani's swift action, I am diagnosed as Stage 1A.    Dr. Khakwani is knowledgeable and is not hesitant to order the necessary tests. He spends the time with you to ask questions, thoroughly explain treatment, and orders the necessary tests.  I feel very lucky to have Dr. Khakwani as my Primary Care Physician.  And I believe that his swift action saved my life!  If this story didn't convince you, I also recommend his office for convenience.  His office is affiliated with the Urgent Care next door.

My fiance and I came into the dealership this week, after a couple of months of searching through used GLK's and wanting information on a new vehicle lease.

Many of the nurses were rude to her during her stay, she struggled to get her pain meds regularly going 12hrs without any pain medication only a few days after surgery. When it came time for her to leave, the doctor wrote her a script for pain meds which she could not fill because the center filled 30days worth of her pain meds a week prior to being released so the insurance would not cover and the pharmacy showed those meds as being filled. When we contacted the care center they told her that they destroy any remaining medications and cannot release them to the patient. I have spent 5 days now trying to go between the care center, her regular doctor, and the insurance to resolve the issue.

IRDF17rbWFWd3E0Dbm74Kg,"Dear <restaurant>Soup Nutsy</restaurant>,  You say your shops offer service \with less emphasis on cantankerousness and more on carefully prepared soups with a smile.\"" Ummm...no. It was more like \""NO SOUP FOR YOU!\"" There are staff who really are Soup Nazis.  I used to be a regular customer who would buy your <dish>breakfast soup</dish> at least 3 times a week on my way to the office. Unfortunately, I will not be going back because there are 2 staff members who tainting the otherwise pleasant experiences I have had there. Today at around 8:45 am I stopped by to buy a large <dish>beef bone broth</dish>. Usually it is a very friendly staff member of Vietnamese descent or another taller brown-haired guy or a lady with sandy brown hair usually in a ponytail who all happily assist me. Because the soups are scalding hot, I usually request and am given a double cup and a double cap. Because you don't offer coffee cup sleeves, the double cup insulates the heat and makes the cup manageable to carry as a have another 15 minutes of walking to reach work, climbing stairs etc. Without the double-cap, the scalding soup spills all over my hand as I walk and it burns or ends up staining my clothes. I've never had an issue until today. One of your staff, a female with burgundy red hair (who has been very rude in the past) told a short male staff member not to give me a double-cup and double-cap. When I requested these, he told me \""I can't give these to you because it's wasting money.\"" If you provided sleeves and a proper cap or cap plug, then I wouldn't need to request these things. I'm not about to have boiling soup spill all over me. It's a matter of customer safety and courteous customer service. I was made to feel like I was asking too much. I was so disappointed that I cancelled my order. I really loved your <dish>breakfast soups</dish> so this is unfortunate.  I hope you will rectify this for your remaining customers. I am sadly no longer one of them!""",1

The second time,  my husband and I went for <occasion>lunch</occasion> and we were told we would have to wait a while until a table was free.  We pointed out at least 3 booths that were empty but we were told those were for groups of 6 and we would have to wait.  There was nobody behind us at the time! Luckily a smaller booth opened up within 5 minutes.  We sat down and waited for our water and menus.  The waiter was literally running around the restaurant and even when he was with us, he was looking over to the other tables.  We ordered fairly quickly but then realized everyone around us was getting served and we weren't....even those that came in after us!  We asked the waiter and he said he would check.  He said it was coming shortly and then he disappeared again.  After waiting some more, my husband told the man at the bar that the service was awful and we had been waiting for our food for over 25minutes.  He went to the kitchen and said it would be ready in 5 minutes!! We got fed up and left as it was obvious the waiter had never even put in our order.  We left, drove to Eddie's wok n' roll, ordered, were served, finished eating and paid all within 20 minutes.  A restaurant that has such quick turnover at lunch needs to ensure they have the staff and service available to meet the needs of their customers.  <restaurant>Tangerine</restaurant>.....take some lessons from Eddie's",1

Each time we used it the driver showed up quickly, and the costs seemed in-line with the fare estimates on the ap. A few times the final fee seemed lower. I'm not complaining.  We used it mainly when wanting to go back to the hotel after a night out eating and drinking in  the Old Montreal area, and were too lazy and bloated to walk back. An $6-$8 Uber ride was so worth it in those instances.  Honestly, it beat driving our own car and dealing with parking hassles. Made our vacation time there a bit easier.",0

q2wt9Pak2e2WUXtZH1EzNA,"We had a fantastic experience with Glen and the rest of the staff at Summerlin Upholstery Works.    A few years ago we had a concrete fire pit and bench poured in the backyard and have been trying to get a cushion made for the bench ever since.  Unfortunately, the bench is not a standard size, so a custom cushion needed to be made.  We did not realize what a hassle it would be to locate a company to make this for us at a reasonable price.  The only one we could find locally was Mr. Pool & Mrs. Patio and they wanted $2,300, so we kept putting it off.    This year we did some research on outdoor fabrics and cushion materials and decided to take a different approach.  We ordered the Subnbrella Outdoor Accord II Crimson fabric on fabric.com, made a template out of poster board and took it to Galaxy Foam (also a fantastic find, see review), then we took the fabric and foam to Summerlin Upholstery Works to assemble it for us.  We learned that SUW could have actually ordered the fabric for us, but we already had it in hand.  Glen was very knowledgeable and went through the whole process, offered suggestions, and showed us his workshop.  We had bought the best outdoor fabric and foam, but he advised that adding a little Dacron (Polyethylene terephthalate) on top of the foam would give the cushions a little loft so they were not super flat.  He also put a different fabric with a larger weave on the very bottom of the cushions so they drained faster if they got wet.  This helps keep mildew and mold away, something we've had issues with on other outdoor furniture.  Lastly, we asked for piping and some sort of tie downs so the cushions did not blow away.  Glen showed us a great option for screw in snaps that has worked very well so far.    The work was done in less than a week and we were only charged $180.  So, the whole project cost less than $500.  Doing a little research and leg work saved us almost $2,000!  amazing!  We liked their work very much and have even taken one of our leather sofa cushions in to get the topstich that had come loose repaired.  They did the work the same day.  I definitely would recommend them for anyone who needs upholstery work done.",0

Our drinks were alright, nothing crazy special -very standard.  Our food took about 40 min to receive. . Service was slow.  We ordered a <dish>sampler platter</dish> which was not good at all - it was full of grease, calamari tasted like rubber, the stuffing in the other items was almost empty and mainly only deep fried wraps.

n3DeiQA6rh9xkDbZikQ1hw,"Amy is truly amazing!!! I hired her to help coordinate my wedding and it was the best decision I made in regards to my wedding. She was available to meet multiple times before the wedding in order to go over what I wanted and what she would need to do the day of the wedding. Amy even visited the wedding site months before so she would have a better idea of where things were. Then Amy completely coordinated the rehearsal. She was a million times better and more organized than the wedding coordinator the venue provided.  The day of my wedding was a dream and ran completely smooth (even though it rained!). Amy was organized down to the tiniest detail. She even made sure I drank water and had food in my stomach. She is an expert at coordinating others. Amy had no problem directing the other vendors and my decorating helpers.  Amy, I cannot say thank you enough! You took all of the stress off of me and I was able to enjoy my big day!

ZNnCj58bx9QrkR7UBlKVrg,"Yesterday I smelled THAT smell - the one that tells you that something electrical is burning out!  Sure enough, my evap cooler motor had fried, and didn't make it through the night.   This morning I took it off and schlepped it up to Indoor Comfort Supply, my go-to place for evaporative cooler parts of a higher quality than the big box store carries, plus friendly and knowledgeable advice. Sure enough, Brian had the motor in stock.  He took pity on this Do-It-Herself on a day that is forecast to top out at 112 degrees, and put the kit together for me.  I appreciate anyone lessening my time on the roof on a day like today!  It's all done and checking in at 78 degrees - yay! I first found this place in the middle of winter, when my roof was being replaced and my roofer suggested that I change the rusted out cooler legs, as long as they were off anyway.  The folks here have always been helpful, and gone out their way to assist me with any questions I have about my evaporative cooler. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to repair a swamp cooler, but their website is very informative and the expert advice is worth the trip for me! FYI, I think the hours on this listing might be a bit off - I found them open at 8 am today (Friday).",0

I can only speculate that the high school students across the street must eat here and that is why this place is still here.  On this occasion, I was in the mood for <dish>chicken pad Thai</dish>, which was on the menu. It seemed reasonably priced at $5.99.  While I was waiting my wife came and we both noticed that the food on the hot table had been there some time and didn't look appetizing. So, she asked about getting some <dish>fresh orange chicken</dish> which was on the board but not on the hot table. She was rejected, they wouldn't make it for her. She left in a huff.  As I was paying for my meal, I noticed that he charged me $1 when the sign said 99 cents, kind of misleading, but because it was only a penny, I let it slide but my eyebrow lifted.  When I got my meal, I opened it to what looked like <dish>chicken rice noodles</dish>, so I brought it back because it wasn't <dish>pad Thai</dish>. I complained. We argued about it.  I took it back, had a bite and realized it was beef! Not what I ordered, so I took it back and complained and we argued more about it.  No satisfactory solution was made.  So, I ate what they served me. It was not <dish>chicken pad Thai</dish>. In fact, the vinegar that they put in the dish made it repulsive and not good to eat.   So, I will not be eating there again, EVER!  This is my warning to you...STAY AWAY, you eat here at your own peril.  This review is not funny because, there was no silver lining to this meal. I gave them a 1 on this review, because I could not give them anything less like a 0 or possibly more accurately a negative number.

That'll look better on you.\""  She was cool and honest. And this is why I miss the east side. When we first moved to Vegas it was to an apartment complex near Sahara and Nellis. Our U-Haul was awkwardly parked in the cramped lot and my sunburnt 1984 Honda Civic fit right in. As we returned from the front office with the keys to our apartment, the neighbors watching us from their porch offered up an ice cold Bud Light, \""It's hot as hell out here.\""   I live for unsolicited conversational opportunities, and these occasions abound in Beauty Warehouse. I don't recall hearing any music over the speakers, but the banter of the ladies in the beauty shop in the back of the store filled the place. As my teenage wig attendant said, \""They're like that all the time, having a good time. They're hilarious.\""   So I left with three synthetic wigs, one eyeshadow compact ($1.99), one lip gloss compact ($1.99) and one fantastic, sparkly purple eyeliner pen ($1.99). Two of the wigs were on sale, 50% off of $25-35. My total bill was around $60.   The most notable aspect of the store is its wig collection, some 150 awesome wigs on display, with the most expensive being just over $100. The attendant was happy to let me try on a dozen of them. We had heard about this place through a wig shop located in the Indoor Swap Meet, whose wigs are $250-350 (beautiful, but not what I needed).  The Beauty Supply Warehouse also has tons of hair dyes and curly-haired products such as Grapeseed oil, all at reasonable prices. The service is friendly and the place is packed with products.

o9K4XEDK16T7LDYrKgstxA,"The <restaurant>Canal Club</restaurant> is a trendy restaurant in the Scott hotel. The decor gives off an island vibe, while still remaining sophisticated.   The service was very awkward. When we arrived we approached an empty hostess stand and waited five minutes or so until the hostess returned. No other employees offered to help us during this time. We had reservations and the hostess told us to \wait one moment\"" and then walked away. She didn't come back for a few minutes so we ordered drinks at the bar. We had to tell the bartenders our drink orders multiple times because they either didn't hear or us or didn't care to hear us (which I assume is the latter because they hardly looked our way).

When we saw her again a few minutes later she was picking up drinks from the bar, looked at us and said \""I guess you can just follow me.\"" Um, what?   Our server was incredibly sweet, but seemed to be a bit unprepared. He did not know much about the menu and did not know anything about the Restaurant Week menus placed at our table.

1SjeqwgRWQTFS8AkgGXqkg,"I've been hypnotized by Sandi many times, both live and recorded, and also attended several classes she's taught. I recently went through her new GastroBand Hypnosis(tm) class. My experiences with her have always been exceptionally good.  Sandi is an outstanding hypnotist, a great teacher, and she's very good at using NLP techniques (neurolinguistic programming - a type of hypnosis that uses things like unusual language patterns and many other things) to make her hypnosis sessions, her hypnosis recordings, and her classes as effective as they can be.  If you do even a little research into hypnosis, you'll find that it's not a \magic pill\"" that can force anyone to completely change their lives. If you don't want to make a change, hypnosis can't force you to make that change. But if you DO want to make a change, hypnosis can make it much easier for you to do whatever you need to do to change. The only requirements for you to be hypnotized and make powerful changes are that you want to make those changes and that you're willing and able to follow simple directions.  The GastroBand Hypnosis weight loss system is working very well for me in the week since I started it. I feel full after only eating a small amount. If I try to eat more, I soon feel overstuffed. It makes eating less food incredibly easy. I cut out 1/2 hour of TV and listen to Sandi's reinforcement CD before bed. It hypnotizes me and strengthens the weight loss hypnotherapy I got in my first live session with Sandi. As a bonus, it relaxes me and makes it very easy to go to sleep.  Sandi gets my highest recommendation as a professional and effective hypnotherapist and teacher.""",0

I don't think anyone else at that store would have provided the same level of service. She was a problem solver and did so happily. And it felt genuine; not a fake ass kisser in order to make a sale and get rid of you. You know that type!

I wasn't sure if this would affect my insurance, so I asked about it, but I said it seemed like it would be okay. Then she said, \""Well, let me just check on it with Mailo [the PCP] on Monday, and I will call you back.\"" And I replied, \""Maybe we should just make an appointment now, and then you can call me if there's something that will change.\"" Then she said, (literally), \""No, I promise, promise, promise I will call you on Monday.\"" So basically, I went through a whole examination and talked to three different people about making an appointment, but STILL nobody set an appointment for me - WHICH WAS THE REASON I WENT IN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

So who knows if I will even hear back. REALLY? I mean, REALLY? They were perfectly nice while doing all of this. What good is that if they won't even set an appointment? Also, I was told I have arthritis, then given a prescription for naproxen. Why bother writing a prescription for naproxen when you could just say \""buy some naproxen\""? I stood in line and waited overnight for the prescription before realizing it was something you can get OVER THE COUNTER. Now I will have to change PCP/location and have to wait even longer to see someone.""",0

As the name says, it's a general store - a lot of varied items, and that's what it suffers from, too much variation, and not enough focus.

It's a bit difficult to find. It's next to HH Gregg, tucked in a little strip mall on the side - worth the effort!  It wasn't too busy when we went but it was a gorgeous day and most people were probably on the lake. We were seated quickly and after a minute or two, the manager (I think) took our drink orders.  He made recommendations on lunch thankfully since we didn't know what the heck a roti was. Turns out, it's like a wrap only it's hot, rectangular and large!  Mine was stuffed with <dish>curry chicken and potatoes</dish> and my husband had the <dish>jerk chicken</dish> (& potatoes, too).  Tons of food and delicious.   Forgot to mention that our server brought out some little rolls/dough puffs before our meal was served. The dipping sauce was pretty spicy - loved it!  With our meal, he brought out a trio of sauces which went from spicy to hot.  I'm a wimp when it comes to heat so it probably wasn't spicy to the average person.  My son went with the <dish>chicken tenders and fries</dish> and I couldn't resist dipping a few pieces in the sauces. Yum!  This place looks like it really gets busy in the evenings. They have a stage in the corner and lots of speakers. I'd imagine if you went there at 11pm on a Friday, you're experience would be much crazier. Still fun, though!

Several Cracks in tiles and a few minor things ... but for me time was of the essence i had to start a new job withing 10 days. I liked the house 4bed 3 bath. 1200 a month  What followed is a model of a good tenant paid my rent every month ON TIME   The problems ...   The Reverse osmosis system was broken i fixed it added new lines and 2 new filters at a cost of 275.00 ... asked them what type of paint had it mixed twice and painted and left the left over paint for them (they didnt even know what color it was... touched up all black marks on the walls left by the previous tenant and filled all the holes from the previous tenant and patched a wall (professionally) when i moved in the back door had a super hole in it.  Upon living there thre were several problems and the management compay did not get back to me for about 7 months to the problems, so I sent a 5 days notice and also sent it to the owner of the house what the problems were  AMAZING they got back to me (the owner of the house) ---- looked them up though Maricopa county   List of my problems   Falling tree $30.00 hoa violation plus $375.00 for me to get removed (its not my house i can't cut trees down)  Water leaking from the upstairs bath into the kitchen threw the kitchen lights - I could not use the bath anymore (fire Hazard)  Water leaking on the back patio when it rains through an into light fixture - (fire hazard)  On /Off Valve for the cold water did not turn off (can you say lake house) -  Well they came and fixed the washer valve and thats about it  after the 5 day notice - (the house can go in a fire but not by flooding)  So i calmly expressed to them i will not be renewing my lease......

When I walked down the hall to my room and opened the door nothing really jumped out at me.  Normal all around, bed, flat screen TV and window.  Wait, did I say window.  Not so fast.

7PH-QDcIpI9-L_LISkLkjg,"My little girl went there for a year. It is an okay dance class. However, let me tell you that if you join this studio you better do and say whatever they want or you and your kids could be mistreat at any moment. I did complain once and this is my experience at AIM:  I didn't enroll my kid for the recital because we are going to be out of town and I didn't buy the dress they sell. One day without ANY previous information the instructor came out during class time to ask the moms to get in and try the recital's dresses on. Of course my girl was super upset because she was the only one without a pretty tutu. I went and told the owner that I was unhappy because they didn't inform it previously and his respond was: he didn't like complains, that was the way they do it and because he didn't appreciated my comment HE DID KICK MY GIRL (WHO IS JUST 3) OUT OF THE CLASS. Keep in mind that he said all these things to me in front of my girl who was already crying all over and my baby boy who was on my arms getting upset too.   This studio asks you to pay in advance for the semester so I lost money because he refused to give me the money back. What??? Wait, It doesn't stop there. All the moms in our class where waiting for us to see what happened and when I was telling them what he did, he walked to us and told us (the kids and I) to get out of his property.  Shame on you AIM. I have not clue how they can have a classes for kids if they don't know how to respect and treat them. Awful service.   I do not recommend this place to any person who loves kids. At the beginning it may looks okay for what you pay but think it twice because with the way they treat you it could be the most expensive and worthless money you ever expend.",0

It's not that I'm some prima donna or something, I just like having some consistency that I can rely on.   So I tried this place with some hesitation. I don't like how you can't make appointments. That's the sole reason for losing a star. You can however write the name of the stylist you prefer. If you go here, ask for Katrina. Unless I'm waiting, then you can pick someone else. lol. But, she's awesome, for a Cowboys fan. They have TV's all over with ESPN, and the girls have referee styled shirts. Honestly, how can you go wrong there?

hySu4oYN7R3sSohuSeEsTg,"Friendly 45 minute indoor cycling with uplifting instructors and solid instructions to help achieve your goals.  A typical class is broken into sections (based on 1 song or a few), and you use the instructor and the bike's computers to guide your workout (example: attempting to maintain a certain pace while increasing resistance, hills, alternating sprints).  Many instructors also teach at Dragonfly Yoga, so the yoga ethos definitely permeates the instructors' attitudes, as the instructors definitely try to make you feel uplifted and good about yourself throughout the class.  Flyght also features a variety of special events and promotions if you are looking to check out something different.  The studio facilities are clean and well maintained, you can ask the front desk for a full size towel for the shower and I've never had to wait to use the shower (though to be fair, I've never gone in the morning when I imagine the demand is highest).  The staff will save your bike's size settings under your account so you can always remember them, a novel feature I have not seen at other studios.

Definitely not what I envisioned for my wedding guests.

This is a company who bragged that they are always so busy with weddings, that it seemed they didn't care whether or not they received our business.

N5qlmVLz6nBKaTF5VBSDmA,"My family and I have been doing our grocery shopping here for years. We absolutely love Heinen's!   The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Some of them even greet us by name. In the few times that I have had an issue here, it has always been corrected in a prompt and reasonable manner.   The products are always top notch and the store is easy to navigate through. The store is clean and was also remodeled a few years ago.   So, you may be asking... why did I knock off a star? Well, the parking lot is very confusing and there are always clueless, impatient, and rude customers driving down the wrong aisle and cutting you off. Although, they sometimes have a police officer on hand to direct traffic, so that's a plus.   I have found that Heinen's is more personalized and friendly than other grocery stores I have been to. I highly recommend shopping here!",0

Their service is so terrible that I was told not to do business with them from my cable provider a few months back.  First off the equipment is garbage and breaks easily.  I tried to cancel in January and my contract was not up and they wanted me to pay $150 to cancel.  They told me to call back 3/30/18 to cancel with no penalty as that was my expiration date.  I called back today to find out that they gave me the wrong info that my contract does not expire until May 11th.  I offered to pay my remaining contract out at $35/mo and they stated that I would have to pay $260 to cancel.  I asked how the cancellation fee increased from $150 in January to $260 in March.  All I got was.....\I don't know what you are talking about sir.\""  They were unwilling to work with me and I stated that I would make sure to give a terrible review of their company and they didn't care!

LXUSC9iSqh2fs1oSuUakbQ,"They are the friendliest auto shop you'll probably ever step foot in - more importantly, they are straight-to-the-point, welcoming, and fast. There is no run-around with inspection outcomes, they will offer you coffee/water/wifi within 2 minutes of you being there, and they've been able to fit me in same-day multiple times.   If you're part of the car care club, you can get oil changes, inspections, tire rotations, car washes, amongst other convenient services, for a very low price, which is HUGE!! Not to mention the cookies when you pick the car back up! I'm not sure if they do it for all companies, but they offer my company drop off/pick up service when vehicles are being serviced that day. Additionally, the inspections are so well-explained, whether in-person, on a phone call, or in the follow-up inspection report that they send you via email that lets you know how imperative certain services are based on the inspection.  To address some of the other reviews, they leave the decision completely up to you in regards to the outcome of the inspection - they have never pressured me into getting the service done with them. I think some of their suggested prices were somewhat higher than what my normal mechanic charged, but I think researching automotive service repairs either online or getting a second quote is an obvious thing to do before spending hundreds of dollars. They make it easy to compare to other shops/online because their inspection report is extremely thorough (thus saving you the time & money of having another mechanic charge you for their inspection). That being said, when I needed to replace all 4 of my tires, Automotive Specialty Service's price was significantly less than what my original mechanic had charged me for tires that were of significantly less quality.",0

iRf1L16ozU-rSfE2MtSIlA,"This place is still open?!?  An airline stranded me in Vegas once, and I thought I'd get a reasonably swanky room.  BZZZT!  This place had minimal style - industrial white paint and garage sale art all the way.  And yet, in its semi-shabby make-do kind of way, it was kinda cool.  Not only a separate bedroom and living room, but a whole kitchen - which I'd want if I were staying in Vegas for an extended period of time.  The website says they have 2-bedroom suites as well - so again, if you're in Vegas for a while with a whole crew, this might be for you.  It's about a mile west of the Strip.  Not a lot of neighborhood charm, though it's across the street from the Orleans (gambling/movies/bowling).    Other weird memories:  The room had a sign posted saying that it went for $400/night, which is definitely too bad to be true (plus I looked it up.  Not $400.  Puh-leez.)  There was also a sign behind the desk alerting all guests that the premises were under video surveillance.  Clerk assured me that was parking lot only, but who knows, maybe I'm at talldudesshowering.com.  Being carted off to a desolate area for the room that time forgot was creep-a-licious enough.",0
MAKV_ZbhTcVA-IcdjKYhRQ,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!! They are unprofessional, and dishonest. We had someone from the company come out to give us an estimate about 3 months before we moved.  He told us it will take 8 hours to move our belongings over a distance of 35 miles. He put an estimate of 11-12 hours to allow for any incidents. When the movers arrived, they had a smaller van and no boxes. It took them 2 days and 2 trips(16 hours instead of the original 8 hours we had been told).   We had to sleep on air mattresses because we had planned on a single day's move. The coordinator of the move, Julie, told us we had received an email stating the move will take 14 hours and 2 days. She also insisted we should have stayed home to \supervise\"" the move. She was rude, unprofessional and a liar.When I insisted we had received no such email and for her to resend the email, she said she had mistakenly told us that because she confused our last name with another clients! Very fishy statement right there.   They ended up charging us 110% of the estimate for the move. I think they try to lure you to choose their company with lower hourly fees and time estimate and then cheat you in the end. We had another company make an estimate to move us in 6-7 hours at a higher  hourly fee but we did not choose them because of the offer Hutchcraft made. The movers themselves were professional and courteous. The corporate company, Hutchcraft, is horrible. Sharing my experience so other people will know what to expect!""",0

The mechanics leave around five, but since it's a gas station, there's someone there later so you can pick up the car until around 8.  Also, they seem to be really fair.

G1NckihorsLxGV0PISHWnw,"After reading a lot of good reviews about this place. I finally decided to go for it. I went there yesterday i.e Saturday around 3:30pm. Here are the pros and cons in my opinion.  Pros -Getting an appointment was a breeze  -My waxer was friendly and approachable  - Done super quickly. In and out within 20 minutes for my first Brazilian. Paid $50.85 with tax -She used Hard wax, soft wax and tweezers wherever required. -Waxer wasn't pushy to sell me any other services or their products.  Cons About The female who booked me in and at the reception that day was same-- -Wasn't keen about getting my name right. - Didn't offer to take my coat or offer some water considering the bad weather. -Asked me how the service was at the end and probably looked a little lost listening to my reply. Eventually she responded to it but I kinda figured she was multitasking. -Never offered/asked me if I wanted to enrol for the membership. I could've surely gotten it if asked. Not asked if I wanted to book in for my next appointment.   About the waxer-- - One thing I missed on noticing was if my waxer actually didn't double dipped the wax stick she used on me. (I hope she didn't) -She suggested me to go for the triangle and I decided to take her suggestion. Unfortunately, the triangle was big enough than I expected and she didn't trim the area either. That I realized after she left the room and mind you I was never asked to check after waxed. So that was a bummer.  -Washrooms are just okay nothing great about it. Very thin cheap quality bathroom tissues and no air fresheners.  Long story short, I somehow felt according to the price and the reputation of this place the services weren't up to the mark. The quality of the job done was good and very less painful than I thought it would be. They didn't do anything that wowed me. Didn't leave me with a luxurious feeling of a high end salon.   The moment of truth-- Will I book my next appointment with them? Maybe, but I will definitely keep looking for other salons who offer better customer services for lesser/same price.",0

t60hkkNiTb8osFx1PKgFAg,"Until the nearby Goodwill closed, the overpriced Double Take was always my 2nd or not 3rd destination choice. Being on the border of Regent Park the price of its clothing, knick knacks, scarves, jewellery does not reflect the economic reality of their customers' income. Many a time I have shown the employees items priced 25-30 cents less than the original price, such as Dollar Store items or Michael's Crafts items. Now the also the very large Salvation Army store on Parliament/Shuter has closed,  they are the ONLY thrift store left east of Yonge&Carleton.  Aside from the price imbalance, their goods are good quality. Also, given the volume of donations they receive relative to their small store means they resell their donations at a profit."

They are never consistent on the day of the week they show up and definitely not consistent about what day they bill my card. Sometimes it's the 5th, sometimes the 12th, sometimes the 20th. They left my back gate open and my dog got out (as we didn't know the gate was open after they left). We had to leave at least 5 (no exaggeration there) phone messages to get a quote on our broken pool light. I will say that our pool has not gone green since they started cleaning, so that is something (oh wait, that's what they get paid for!) but there is nothing extraordinary about them.

There's  a whole aisle just dedicated to party supplies and decorations that you can get items  for  whatever parties/events being hosted.   Aisles are very spacious and everything  is neatly organized.  It has everything one may need for a dollar and slightly  more depending  on what you get.  There's even a good selection for baby items, pet supplies, seasonal items and whatever else you need for the household.  Staff were very friendly  and greeted  me upon entering  and exiting.

LB8K312W4DoGSkStkNmzNA,"I am l.i.v.i.d. Our one-man pool company was bought out by Sunburst a few months ago. We were told nothing would change with our service, except that our guy was being promoted to management (so, pretty much everything is going to change for us, no?)  Our new guy starts coming out and he's less than professional, but whatever, he's a pool guy. He is supposed to be coming on Friday mornings but wouldn't show up until around 3, for weeks we would tell him how this time doesn't work and he needs to come earlier. He told us he was lazy on Friday mornings and couldnt get here earlier, but that he'd try. Next thing we know he starts coming on Saturdays!? (I am a caretaker at this property with 2 pools, staff is expected to work weekdays and the family does not want people working in/around their home on the weekends.)   We've also been scolded on multiple occasions by this guy for not caring for the pools and fountains - uh, hello buddy, that's what we're paying you for!   I reached out to my old pool guy and found out he was never even hired on with Sunburst and was with another company now, I asked him to come back.   So, this afternoon my partner tells the guy from Sunburst that this is the last time we'll be seeing each other, just to say goodbye and what was going on... and then he just left!? He totally skipped out on doing the main house pool and they are having guests tomorrow!  Unacceptable.   My partner calls Bryce and that's when everything hit the roof.  He doesn't seem to care at all that his employee left the job that we've prepaid for - it is exactly this type of leadership that creates the type of business that has a 2-star Yelp review. I cannot believe the total lack of care on Bryce's part. He was so quick to offer a refund, totally missing the entire commitment/responsibility/customer care portion of running a business.  What a total jerk!  So now we're waiting to see if anyone is in the area and has time to service us? I cannot believe he doesn't hold his employee responsible and make him come back regardless of the time, but would rather fight with us about our being dissatisfied!?

But me trying on all these huge dresses I WAS DYING. There was a little fan in the dressing room, but it barely helped. The dressing him was just a little curtain in the corner, so not a lot of ventilation.   I wear a size 16, and they had barely anything to fit me... Which I am not very large so I found that surprising. This was my first bridal appointment, so when they were fitting me into dresses 4-6 sizes larger than what I usually wear I was pretty disappointed. Like I can go into any normal non-plus size store, and find stuff that fits me. But they were putting me in dresses that were size 30. They acted like that's the way every store is, but I had no sizing issues at other stores. They didn't have anything in the flowy silhouette I wanted, just modified A-line and ballgown type dresses. I don't know if that was just the luck of the draw for when I went, or if they really just don't carry much.   All that to say, I think my stylist was really trying to accommodate me. She was very nice. But they simply didn't have a large enough selection for me to find anything I liked, and they should really vouch for better AC in JUNE in PHX."

I sang:  A court is in session, a verdict is in No appeal on the docket today Just my own sin The walls are cold and pale The cage made of steel Screams fill the room Alone I drop and kneel So I held my head up high Hiding hate that burns inside Which only fuels their selfish pride We're held captive Out from the sun A sun that shines on only some We the meek are all in one  Thank You my Friend. The Flaming Dr. Peppers hit the spot.  I hear a thunder in the distance See a vision of a cross I feel the pain that was given On that sad day of loss A lion roars in the darkness Only he holds the key A light to free me from my burden And grant me life eternally  Should have been dead On a Sunday morning Banging my head No time for mourning Ain't got no time  I cry out to God Seeking only his decision Gabriel stands and confirms I've created my own prison"
XjC89x8uGa3DiRB-k9Gn3w,"I enjoyed working with David, and as a first-timer with buying a custom suit, he was very educational and provided great insight. I don't have much eye for fashion, but I explained to him some things I do like, and I trusted his judgement from there. I couldn't be happier with the results!  The suit arrived more quickly than expected, and it did need one small tweak once it came back, but the change was made quickly.  I definitely plan to use his services once again!"
NztyCglNuL88hxU9aUd5xA,I moved to PIttsburgh about a year ago and have not had great success in finding a hair salon.  I came to Copacetic based on a referral from a coworker who had really cute hair so I was hopeful.  Boy I am glad I went.  Valerie did an amazing job with my cut and was engaging and you could tell she enjoys what she does.  Plus the prices are affordable and everyone was so friendly.

w3PfX6FXRzeFOiqdI3ii6g,"When I heard that the old <restaurant>Stromboli Inn</restaurant> is resurrected in my neighbourhood of Bridgeland, I kinda got excited.  Afterall, a good pizzaria is an integral part of any good neighbourhood.  <restaurant>Stromboli Inn</restaurant> is located next to Villa Firenze in a small house on the same property.  There's a family connection between the two businesses.  The place is very small with only four tables and a few extra chairs by the door where you can wait if you choose to take out.  We ordered the <dish>'Giuseppe'</dish>, their house special at $23 for the 12 inch or you can have an 8 inch for $19.  The pizza took a long time to make, nearly 40 minutes.  If you're waiting for a take-out, you can always head across the street to Luke's Drugstore and grab a coffee and check out their vinyl selection.  It'll beat sitting by the door as the place filled up while we were waiting and it got quite hot and stuffy fast.  Carrying it home, the pizza felt quite hefty.  In fact, at first glance, it reminded me of the old Karouso's pizza with that thick outer crust.  The <dish>Giuseppe</dish> had pepperoni, salami, bacon, mushrooms, baby shrimp, anchovies, and green peppers.  Though not a fan of baby shrimp or green peppers, the shrimp in this case was nicely seasoned and the peppers had a nice texture which, in the end, give the pizza an added dimension.  The crust, which is thicker than the neapolitan style that's in vogue now, is surprisingly light and airy, even the outer crust.  Personally, I would've prefered a little more sauce and cheese.  But all-in-all, not a bad pie and definitely a welcomed addition to the neighbourhood.",1

cVEH-HfaZgl-SuROl_Z7SQ,"You can never have too much cheese if you ask me and when you are craving some cheesy goodness look no further than <restaurant>Le Cheese</restaurant>.  This little diner is an ode to all the classic cheesy comfort food of your youth.  If you are in the mood for a classic <dish>grilled cheese</dish> or <dish>mac and cheese</dish> just like you used to have as a kid then come here for that fix.  It is located right on Monkland Ave about a 15 minute walk from the Villa Maria metro.  It is on a quieter section of the street so parking should be pretty easy should you drive.  The place is pretty tiny and I could see where on a weekend seating may be hard to come by.  You order at the counter and your food is brought to you when it is ready.  They make it fresh to order so it might take a few minutes but the wait is worth it!  I was starving so I went all out ordering the <dish>Cheese Steak</dish> in a combo with <dish>fries</dish> and <dish>tomato soup</dish>.  I was a little disappointed that there were no tater tots to be seen on the menu especially since other Yelpers have raved so much about them and I was dying for a taste.  This came out to about $19 but it was a ton of food so it was worth the price.  The <dish>tomato soup</dish> was DA BOMB! It is seriously one of the best tomato soups I have ever tasted.  It had a creamy texture and well balanced flavour.  The <dish>philly cheese-steak</dish> kind of fell flat for me.  If memory serves me it was supposed to have a jalapeno cheese sauce but for something that supposedly contained hot peppers it didn't have much of a spicy kick to it.  The <dish>fries</dish> were very well seasoned and they had added rosemary for a little extra flavour which added a nice touch.  I also tried a bit of my friend's <dish>Batman grilled cheese sandwich</dish> which had cheese, bacon, tomatoes and avocado.  All I can say is holy grilled cheese Batman!  It was pretty good and it made me wish I had gotten that instead of the <dish>Philly Cheese Steak</dish>.  <restaurant>Le Cheese</restaurant> is awesome and definitely merits more visits to check out what else they have to offer.  For all the cheese fans out there this is definitely the place to come to satisfy your cravings.",1

But I'm glad that a year after that I happen to come in for a business emergency and found out that she no longer works there... So now I'm glad to say that I am back as a loyal, happy customer.    They recently remodeled the place- so it looks more organized and updated.  They have bilingual staff - Japanese and Spanish people that can help you out with anything :P.

W6Do-RqSULOil1LtZ6XwxA,"I logged on to Tempe Takeout and noticed <restaurant>BBQ2U</restaurant> was on our map for delivery so my wife and I thought we'd try them out.  I wasn't looking for BBQ per se but just something different.  I ordered a <dish>Breakfast Carnivore Platter</dish> and a side of <dish>Battered Waffle Fries</dish>.  I told you this was weird.  I placed the order at 6:30 and they said it would be a 45 min.-1 hour delivery time which I was perfectly fine with.  I saw they were on Broadway but in Phoenix.  I ordered on TempeTakeout.com.  I Googled the address and this place was a good 13 miles away.  I thought that would be too far for delivery so I called the restaurant directly and told them where we lived and thought that was awful far for delivery.  I told them I'd certainly understand if they wanted to cancel the order but they said they wanted to keep the order and I thought that was cool.  Then I got a second call around 7 pm saying they were a little backed up for delivery and may not show up until 8.  At this point what do you do?  If I placed another order, it would take about an hour to get to me so I told them that was fine.  The driver arrived at 8, aprx. 90 minutes for delivery.  My <dish>Breakfast Carnivore Platter</dish> was pretty good.  My <dish>scrambled eggs</dish> were really delicious and I got a nice size order of <dish>bacon</dish> and <dish>sausage</dish> with the meal.  It also came with <dish>biscuits and gravy</dish> and a piece of <dish>brisket</dish>.  The gravy was was nice and thick but the biscuits were hard even after soaking in gravy.  The piece of \<dish>brisket</dish>\"" I got was not good at all.  Too fatty on one half and dried out on the other half.  This is not <dish>brisket</dish> and it had horrible flavor.  My <dish>battered waffle fries</dish> were real rubbery but I guess that's what you get for sitting in a styrofoam container for about 45 minutes?  My wife ordered the <dish>Chicken with Mashed Potato Bowl</dish> and that was real good and loaded.  She also ordered <dish>onion rings</dish> and they were terrible like the <dish>waffle fries</dish>.  <restaurant>BBQ2U</restaurant> tried and they were real friendly but I don't think I'd order delivery from them again just because I feel bad having the driver come 13 miles each way to deliver and I can't afford to pay a an extra delivery surcharge plus give the driver a couple of extra bucks on top of a normal 20% tip I give anyway.  The food was hit and miss (more hit than miss).  If I'm in the area, I might give them another shot at another time.""",1

It's clean and comfortable during the day but  there can be some sketchy characters kicking around late at night.

I was able to book an appointment for their opening week and loved everything about my visit!  The salon is beautifully decorated in a mix of modern and rustic pieces, with comfy chairs to wait in, beverages to help you pass the time (water, coffee, wine, beer), as well as an open industrial atmosphere.    My stylist, Kim, proved why she's my favorite and one of the best in the biz - she gave me an amazing haircut and put my mind at ease before snipping and styling me into a fantastic shoulder-length cut. Their prices are great, the staff is excellent and refined at what they do, and the environment is clean, cool, and comfortable. If you're looking for a change of scenery or an excuse to check out a new salon, you'll be in great hands at Copacetic!"
Ww9wpXDeZcRFbo0oZr4Dhg,"Living Water over-delivered on every promise and commitment they made to us!  They were flexible with their design and actually listened to what we wanted and needed in our backyard landscaping.  They even did a flexible design so that we could later add the elements that we really wanted, but couldn't afford at this time.   They were not the least expensive, but they were the only ones that we got estimates from who were consistently professional, on-time and delivered on their expertise!  The crew was polite, professional and made our patio and yard look amazing!  They finished in about 1/2 the time that they promised and even took care of approval from the HOA for us as part of their pricing!   As somebody who has been a customer service trainer for over 20 years, I can honestly say that this company knows how to deliver on customer service!   I can't wait to use them again for our outdoor kitchen and hot tub!!   Living Water was worth every penny we paid and we recommended them to all of our neighbors!!!

OQiTik-KQ-kw_fsq9HTf1g,"Several months ago I gave this place a 3 star. I talked about the constant changing of management, the terrible office hours, and the blatant disregard of any issue that their residence have. I am following up after renewing for another year (only because moving all my stuff was a huge pain up those tiny stair cases). This place has literally gotten worse for all of the reasons I mentioned in my first review. Management has changed again, and now the leasing manager, Susanne, is impossible to get a hold of. They answer the phone maybe 30% of the time and are in the office 60% of the time. To be frank, I feel bad for them. Clearly whoever owns Uptown Gardens is not giving these ladies the tools they need to do their job correctly. Second, Uptown gardens has many things that are wrong but they don't care enough to try and fix. The maintenance team is so incompetent there were several times I had to go back and REFIX whatever they tried to hack together. There's definitely a bug issue that they're avidity trying to avoid. Our air ducts or AC was not working properly all summer which resulted in a $155 bill each month (to be fair though they finally compensated us for part of our bill after I reluctant about letting it go). And lastly they dont fix or maintenance amenities such as the grills or the vacuum station. Whoever said Uptown Gardens is a pig with lipstick is 100% correct."
8sqK9QWuXUf2AtmWgZcVLw,"I am fairly disappointed with Custom Eyes in general.  From my second experience about a month ago, I get a call from the optometry office two days before to get my check-up scheduled in. I asked the receptionist what the earliest time that was available for certain date and how long the check-up takes; she replied saying that 10am is their earliest and is the office opening time, and because I am the first patient of the day, it will usually take 30mins. So obviously, with the information given, you plan your day accordingly.  The day of my appointment, I get to the office 5mins before opening time (10am), the office was still closed. You would expect the office to be open 5-10mins early to prep up the day before opening time. The person with the key arrives few minutes late. I go in to check-in and sat there waiting. I was called in about 10:20am to see the optician for my preliminary testings before seeing the optometrist. He was thorough and was explaining what each machine does. I also asked him if the doctor was in or if she have arrived yet because I was in a hurry. The optician told me that she was in but was on a conference call, so I took his word for it. After the testing, I was directed in another area to wait for the optometrist.  The optometrist comes in at 10:30am and was doing her things before she saw her first client of the day. At this time it was about 10:40am when I was called into her office to see her. She apologized for her tardiness. After seeing her,  I was directed to another associate to explain about lens that was recommended to me; I found the associate a bit pushy and was asking about my insurance, and was given the quote of the specialty lens. The associate then told me that I had another test that had to be done by the optician; I told the associate I was in a hurry and I told her that I was told that this check-up was only suppose to take 30mins. The associate told the optician, and within 5mins my test was taken; however, after the test I had to wait another 5mins to have the optometrist to review the photos and explained to me what the photos were illustrating. She was knowledgeable and informative and asked if I had any questions for her.   In the end, I left the office at 11:30am. Again, my appointment was scheduled for 10am and I was given the information that the appointment will take approximately 30 minutes.  I was expecting myself to be done about 10:40am give or take, not at 11:30am.  Overall, I was upset because of the tardiness from the optometrist and the associates. The associates did not apologize on their behalf on being late and did not have the decency to at least tell me that the optometrist was running late, or acknowledge the waiting time."

2Ak3LSfJbWa5-nYepk7VDA,"I am writing this review based on my experience with their quote process and expected payment terms.  I contacted kitchen az to provide a quote on the full remodeling of my kitchen.   I received a call back within a couple hours and the estimator was at my home the next day.  She was personable and provided good suggestions. I really thought this was a strong contending company for our work. Towards the end of our consult, I asked about their typical payment terms.    She indicated 65 percent on contract signing and 35 percent when the kitchen cabinets arrived.  I was flabbergasted.   I said, you are asking for 100 percent payment before any work is done and I would not agree to those terms.   She indicated I had other recourse if I was not happy with their work.  She also said that they had too many people default and were carrying 60,000 in uncollectables and they simply would not do that any more.  She also said, you know we have to pay our crew.   I said, I would be happy to set up an escrow or other arrangements, but simply would not pay a contractor outright 100 percent of the fees before any work was done.   She said she would check with the owner and get back with me.   That was a month ago.  I never received the quote that she indicated would be forthcoming in four days nor a call to indicate that they were not willing to adjust their payment schedule.    It is okay if we could not reach an agreement.  A company can ask for whatever the general public is willing to do.  However, a call back would have been the expected way to end the interaction.   As someone in the finance field, I would never pay a contractor 100 percent prior to any work being done.  Not out of concern for quality.  My concern is I would not want to be stuck should a contractor declare bankruptcy or restructure in the time between my payment and the job finishing.    Consumers should always validate the financial health of a company, the amount of debt they are carrying  and know what they are getting into before agreeing to any payment terms that do not reflect the level of work done."

Seating inside this place is limited, however, there is a outdoor patio with seating in the summer months (I suppose winter too if you are so inclined). A drive through is also available and takes some getting used to its unconventional central lot entrance location, but once you've driven through, its no longer an issue.   The front door is located on the south side of the building, making the westerly located parking lot mismatched and awkward to navigate when looking for the entrance spot, but again, once you've been there, no longer an issue.""",1
tOQ-MlKCdLB1wna0m6lsfw,"I have to rate this casino higher than most people are rating it. It loses a star for its scary, industrial exterior but it truly is part of the great surprise of walking in and being shocked how nice and LARGE it is. I felt like I was in a cleaner, more upscale version of a Fremont St casino in Vegas. NOT the strip variety of casinos, but Fremont St. Every employee we encountered there was super nice. They learned (the cashier) that it was our first time in and they bought us a drink! Clean as a whistle, decent looking carpet, set up is good. There are little tables everywhere to set your empty drinks down so they do not collect all over the slot machines. Waitresses are kind of scarce until later into the evening hours for drinks but the bar is central and easy to find. The machines are varied and fun. There is an area for table games, VLTs and for watching the track on TV with seating. The place actually smelled airy and fresh, not one whiff of smoke present like you find at other places.  Apparently, the restaurant inside is very good and always has food specials. Self serve pop, coffee and pitchers of ice water. GREAT for the DDs. No one bothers you at this place about anything (EX membership signups) and it apparently never gets too busy. I spoke with a nice lady patron who said that she had been going to Century for years and in its heyday was THE place to be with fantastic entertainment. I would return. We kind of stumbled upon it in the south end by accident but not a bad place at all to spend a couple of hours on a rainy evening to try your luck or watch a game on one of their many TVs.",0

Tjd4fcW4Rf-MLGRAog_JSg,"So it's about time that I wrote a review for Crossfit Tempest... I've been working out here for the past year and a half.    The coaches/owners are great! They are professional, knowledgable, helpful, fun, challenging, and encouraging.   It's obvious that they love what they do and they enjoy sharing it with us.    The classes are efficient and well organized.  I get an incredible, multi-faceted workout in only one hour.  Even though these are group classes, I feel like the coaches make an effort to give each and every person as much quality, individual attention and encouragement as possible.   They will correct me if I make a mistake but they will also champion my successes.   Accountability is huge in this box.  If I miss a few classes because I'm getting lazy, someone will follow up with me and encourage me to get back into the routine. It's not like a regular gym where no one notices if you aren't there.    The box is clean and well maintained.  It doesn't smell like a gym.  It doesn't have a smell.  This is pretty incredible given the amount of sweating that goes on in there every day.    I enjoy the community atmosphere at the box.  I have met so many wonderful, interesting people here.   I would recommend Crossfit Tempest to anyone - with the one warning that the workouts will be hard.  It's a great place for the most experienced crossfitter (we do have two people from our box competing in the Games, YAY) to the person that's never tried Crossfit before - like me, when I first started.  It's empowering to work out here. I feel like an athlete :)."
OZhRvcJ8WjnvRaRQVirD6w,Walked in and ordered <dish>veggie fried rice</dish>.  Cashier took my $5 and gave me change.  He then proceeds to go to the kitchen and grab ingredients to cut up for the <dish>fried rice</dish>.  I yelled back to him that he shouldn't be touching food after handling money without washing his hands.  He walks back and washes his hands and then starts cutting the veggies.  I grabbed he change and told him to give me my $5 back.  He did and I left.  Kitchen full of other workers and nobody said anything.  The people in this establishment don't even have the basic common sense to keep their hands clean.  Avoid this place if you have any standards.,1

I am so happy with how they came out. She provided a variety of shots and delivered more photos than we initially discussed.   I will be happy to use her and Michaelangelo's again in the future!",0
nekpzd-Nsg7ZsCAIHUkhmw,"Stopped here on our way home from biking recently.  The food was decent but the portions were a lot smaller than I expect from a Mexican joint.  Usually it is no trouble for our two 5 year olds to split an adult platter with food to spare but I ordered them a \<dish>super quesadilla</dish>\"" with shrimp to split and it was't all that super in size - we finished everything on the table and had hungry crabby kids.    My husband got <dish>carnitas</dish> which he said were OK, just smaller portions than he expected.  My oldest son got the <dish>steak tacos</dish> which were good and a decent amount - 3 soft tacos, nicely filled.  I got a <dish>super shrimp quesadilla</dish> for myself and it was tasty but it's just a quesadilla which is kind of hard to screw up.   The small portions wouldn't have been as big a deal if they weren't also stingy with the chips and salsa.  For 6 people they brought us one small basket of chips and maybe 1/3 of a dish of salsa - the salsa bowl actually had marks in it like they had poured us more, then decided to dump some out.  No refills offered.    Maybe we were extra hungry from biking but we found the portion size to be very lacking.  I'm really torn between giving them a 3 and a 4 rating.  If they hadn't been stingy with the chips I'd have given them a 4.  It wasn't horrible but there was nothing amazing about it, either.     I don't think they had a kid's menu.""",1

I immediately took the dog to Dr. Sorm who was very busy, but took the time to write down what we should do to get her to throw up the seed.  She also told us that if that did not work we should not waste time in getting to an emergency care center.  She even wrote down directions on how to get there.  I thought her concern was way over the top. We took her home, did what Dr Sorm recommended and out came the seed - what a relief!  We are not Ohio residences, but will always use her when we are in Ohio."

I know it may not seem like much but great job Ciara I enjoyed my time over there and will be back soon."

As well, the movers we hired said that they preferred these reusable boxes to those from competitors because these ones are easier to handle and don't hurt the hands.  Fabian and his crew were super nice and accommodating.  Would definitely use these again.  This was honestly the smoothest move I have ever had and this is coming from someone who moves every 2 years on average!"

qDEDMU2Yt9TcJXikzZrwsA,This is one nail salon that I will not be coming back to. I am new to Pittsburgh and read the awesome reviews and was hopeful. When I arrived the place seemed run down and unsanitary. There were men (presumably family of the salon) standing around and sitting in the pedicure chairs. They seemed angry and made me feel uncomfortable. The young woman doing my nails seemed nice enough until she started pressuring me to get a gel manicure. I got one because she convinced me that it would last on my cruise honeymoon. She was wrong. After the third day they started peeling and after a week they looked disgusting. The worst part is the entire time she was doing my nails she was watching the talk show on the TV behind us. I left with a crappy gel set and feeling more stressed than pampered. Do yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere.

I think there are some issues because it is new, it is popular, and it gets crazy on Fridays and Saturdays. I went on Sunday and still had to wait in a line but it went quickly and wasn't and issue. I think in time it will get more efficient on busy days. Service was great, our food was surprisingly good, beer was tasty, and the place is just fun!  Definitely feels like Oktoberfest with the great German band they had playing. I look forward to coming back in the summer when the outside area is all open.  If you can, check out the Hermit Club portion of the complex. A very cool historic building that fits perfectly with the Hofbrauhaus!",1
V9OIBO95GDFRvQMcKsNT2w,"The Market LV is a charming edition to Tivoli that promises more creative, locally-owned spots for knocking out some shopping from cupcakes to wedding gowns and everything in between. It is a second level spot with small shop spaces available to lease. It has the feel of an urban loft with lots of exposed surfaces and concrete floors, which lends me to believe I am visiting some edgy, on-the-brink neighborhood when I am actually in Summerlin. Current tenants include Cupkates, a candy shop, a shop that specializes in board games, a home goods spot, a clothing boutique, a custom wedding gown shop, a spot for cheese, a wine bar is coming soon I think, and there is even a Fashion Camp of some sort. Oh, and a jewelry store that I could have done some damage at if given the time. I don't think the shops all have consistent hours, so you may arrive to find you can't have a cupcake, but overall, I think the concept is great, and I am eager to see what else will open up here. I will definitely keep it top of mind as the holidays near and gift-getting ensues!"

hPclwunHi36YV8cPghWJBg,"Great food options, perfect spice, good prices and fast delivery.  <restaurant>Thai Food To Go</restaurant> is located in a small strip mall just east of McLeod on Desert Inn. It is staffed by very friendly people, it is a clean restaurant, but most of all, the food is GREAT!  This is my go to Thai place, and it happened by accident one day.  I was at Del Taco (please don't judge me), and I saw this place in the same plaza.  So another day when I was looking for Thai food, I happened here.  The <dish>Pad Thai</dish> is excellent, the flavors are delicious and it is always a great answer to the \What's for dinner?\"" question.  They cook the chicken perfectly, and when I've wanted it extra spicy, it fills my spicy needs.  When I ask for not as spicy, I can still taste the great flavors.  Definitely one of my favorite dishes.  The <dish>Drunken Rice</dish> is always another of my \""go to\"" dishes.  The rice is complemented perfectly with the vegetables and chicken.  Again the chicken is done perfectly and there is a good mix- not like some places where there is a little chicken, and mostly rice and vegetables.  The spice is always perfect too.    I've had delivery from here, and it is usually quick.  Pick up is always ready by the time I get there, and when I order to go, it is usually 5-10 minutes before it is ready.  If you're on the east side of Vegas and want a great Thai option, you can't go wrong trying <restaurant>Thai Food To Go</restaurant>.""",1

It almost seemed like I was in a Denny's or Norm's diner. The food was average. What turned me off mostly was the fact that my waitress was taking advantage of me with the bill. I had brought Canadian money in advance for my trip. The waitress said that on the bill I should add a tip, as she lectured me that other restaurants will take advantage of me if I don't look at the bill carefully. The bill had already added the tax and tip and yet she said it didn't. I do not recommend anyone to go here whatsoever.",1

Besides this, they have the run of the mill games/sports as well....you just have to check their schedule with the more than friendly and caring staff.

Don't forget the nice park if you prefer the outdoors only or in addition."
Wde8Ar4-guQU96FrNYED8g,A joke. Not sure if it's a joke on us - or the kids. I've taken my kids here several times - mostly because it is one of the few things in town for them to do. I wouldn't recommend it. Dirty - everything is dirty and dusty. Broken - all the toys/exhibits(seriously - it's a BIG stretch to call them that) are almost always broken. And if your lucky - the dino exhibit outside will be open. I've been there 3 times - and have NEVER seen it open (all times were in the summer too). Plus - $7 to get in??? Seriously?? Save your money & take your kids to the pool - they'll enjoy it way more and you'll actually get your money's worth....

Nothing special in the bakery or cold meats counter. The market never seams busy so I'm surprised it has lasted so long. On the positive side - they have the absolute best rotisserie chicken, especially the Montreal spice flavor. They also have a good internal branded pasta sauce that I like.   I prefer Longo's and Loblaws but stop by Michael Angelos for the chicken and pasta sauce.",0
0q8A_jB8ft7vExBQpxL2lg,"I have a notion that over time the reviews for this place will get significantly more positive.  It just needs some time time to infuse into its new surrounding ... because this is all I'm really gathering why people have the most beef with the Willow House.  The building is interesting and quaint, which is suitable for an indie coffee house and a pretty killer lawn out in front.    The coffee itself is above average.  I'm not particularly blown away or anything ... but then, no coffee REALLY blows me away anyhow.  I'll drink motor oil if the place has a cool vibe and is local and is some sort of vehicle for the local arts.  <restaurant>Willow</restaurant> caters to all three of these requirements.   Plus, they DO have a delicious drink -- their <dish>Chai Charger</dish> -- basically a Chai latte with a shot of espresso ... hot or cold seems perfect for sitting on their patio and smoking Parliaments.

A3H749M1AEggNylDQ5Fr-A,"I could not be more enthusiastic about my recommendation of Dion and his crew. I hired Dion to renovate a bonus room of the brand new house we just moved into. Dion came same day to give me an estimate and had the most reasonable pricing. He started the very next day, on time and explained everything that would be done. On the second day of work with the project set to complete the next day, the universe threw a giant wrench in the works. Heavy monsoon rains revealed multiple flooding, drainage and plumbing issues. What started out as a simple, one room change quickly turned into a whole house renovation! Dion assured me he could help resolve it all. He revised his quotes and discussed how to fix each problem. For the plumbing, his estimate was more reasonable than the plumbing company I had already used! And Dion's price included fixing drywall and floors, which the plumbing company could not do. He worked with me to get all the major issues repaired. He and his crew were always flexible about changes and there were absolutely no surprise costs. He communicated through the entire process with texts and pictures so that I could make decisions quickly and keep the project on the timeline. The house looks amazing and there are zero water issues!!!"

nIEhsGbw0vJuYl05bzzj6Q,"I was led to Bloom and Blueprint by my fantastic photographer, who seemed to get the vibe and type of wedding we were looking for and knew this might be a good fit. I met with Kate and Erika and instantly fell in love. I had spoken to other planners in the Valley and they all made me feel as though I was below their pay grade and that they only wanted to work on weddings that were on the more luxe end. I never got that impression from these ladies and they always made it apparent they were more than willing to accommodate any budget.  We ended up hiring them for partial planning, design and florals. I had an inkling of what I wanted for our big day, but had a hard time vocalizing exactly what it was we were hoping for or making it come to life. You see the boards on Pinterest and think \I want that!\"" but it's difficult to execute. Kate was able to take my confusing words and ideas and pinned ideas and turn them into reality. She came up with several ideas that helped really bring the concept together and make it a cohesive and beautiful day. And her florals are UNBELIEVABLE! I received so many compliments on her work! She and Erika were both very responsive throughout the process and recommended vendors where I needed them and were great about giving feedback on what I needed to be doing and when.   The wonderful Erika helped orchestrate the timing of the day and make sure everything and everyone knew when it was supposed to be happening. Her organizational skills are top notch! Our wedding ended up being on one of the coldest and rainiest days Arizona has seen in quite a bit. We had an outdoor ceremony and cocktail hour planned and Erika was able to rearrange the format and still make our day perfect, rain or shine. She and the other Bloom and Blueprint ladies worked their tails off throughout the reception to make sure it all went off without a hitch!   I definitely recommend reaching out to these ladies to make your wedding dreams come true!"""

The lads are a full service shop here, as a higher end gentlemen's store the only thing you need is socks.  They'll lace the shoes up and provide a shoe horn for the fitting.  Always love their odds and ends too.  If they don't have it in store, get fitted and they'll have it on your door step in less than a week."
q1qjPXe0C2VXTInnWNLudQ,came in here one night with my boyfriend. I came here a lot when it used to be spin so it was my first time at d spot and it is NOT better than spin. prices are so high and I observed the owner Rahim's behaviour after he came to our table to introduce himself. very bossy towards his workers and the employees make customers to vote for them and give them 5 star ratings which is not fair because this place is not good what so ever. very stingy with their adds on and limited amount is being given. will not recommend.

Ldr9o7dgVkm27PME_l0Yfw,"Everything about this experience that was GOOD happened online. I had decided to buy Mr. Rosie S. a PS3 for his birthday. I shopped around, asked friends and colleagues for advice, and then decided Future Shop offered the best package deal.   So, I went online and reserved my system at my chosen location on Eg (on the way home from work) to be picked up later that day (3-4 hours later). The process was brilliantly smooth and easy, and I received a confirmation email. Off to the bricks and mortar store to collect!  When I got there, there were THREE - count 'em - THREE customer service reps at the Customer Service Desk, and ONE, yup ONE other customer. There was one rep dealing with said guy, and the other two FS staff just stood there, mouths agape, apparently in awe of what customer service looks like... ...maybe it was the first time they had witnessed it, and that's why they ignored me?  At any rate, it was unbelievable. This went on for about five minutes. FOR REAL. I was getting furious when another rep from the floor FINALLY noticed I was about to explode, and came over to help me. Within 30 seconds he had located my order and accompanied me to the checkout.  So good job, one guy. The rest of the staff are seemingly useless.  I'll be doing all my \Future\"" business elsewhere or exclusively online from now on!"""
y3re6MMixKz0YIJyVenkIg,Gave them a call and had my appt early in the morning. They told me 8am-10am was available so I told them to show up early at 8. On the day of my appt the tech called around 720 and told me he will show up at 8. Very punctual and actually he came early. went in my house and diagnosed the problem. He was really knowledgable of the repair and gave me pointers on how to lengthen the life of my washer. I was really impressed on how local businesses take care of you compared to the large corporate ones. If you have any problems with your household appliances dont hesitate to call these guys. kudos to all of you guys! thanks johnny!!

RGiM2yAT99WGcO9FtgCKDw,Amazing Discoveries is a great local gaming store! I like the knowledgeable staff and friendly faces. This store sell miniature gaming and card gaming.

Bathroom is relatively clean and so is the store. Snack and drinks are available and everything is market pricing.

Most gringos get a little nervous eating anything from Mexico but as a past expert in worldwide seafood I can tell you that the fish from the Sea of Cortez is some of the least polluted seafood in the world. No nukes, no factory waste, and low population centers on the ocean.  I was looking for a Mexican seafood store and heard about this place from my co-worker. Don't let that fishy shop smell dissuade you from shopping here. Even the cleanest shops smell fishy because they sell fish. You won't find fish this fresh in Scottsdale.",0

Also, they have my name on a white board greeting new patients, so that was pretty cool too.  The hygienists and dentist were very friendly and professional.  The office was clean and modern.  Rosie helped explain exactly what my insurance covered and what my costs would be about any of the procedures I had done, so there were no surprises.  Overall good experience."

He knows what he is doing and makes sure you understand his process too- from regular cleaning to dental procedures. He doesn't think going to the dentist should be an unpleasant experience and has always gone out of his way to make sure I was comfortable and happy with my cleaning. Dr. Walker doesn't miss anything- he found a spot on my lip he thought might be cancerous and sent me immediately to my dermatologist (turned out to be nothing).  Dr. Walker's office is a family affair as his wife works at the front desk and personally takes appointment calls. You can just tell there's something different about A Gentle Touch Dentistry.   On a personal note, Dr. Walker is a Cornhusker, so maybe I should dock him a star ;-)"

EEuvn429FJLS_rbKEbasIQ,"I am offering this review solely as a response to the rant posted on 2/13/2017 by the reviewer that seems to have deeper issues with her parents than with Shuppe's Auto Shoppe.   Shuppe's has worked on two of my three vehicles in recent years and I have found the repairs to have been made in a competent, satisfactory manner. Some of this work has included sophisticated powertrain replacement on an out-of-warranty Japanese prestige brand. I have been pleased with the repairs in every instance.   In one instance, mechanic Aaron was able to complete the installation of a high-output headlamp back into its tiny and awkwardly-placed socket in less than 15 minutes, when I had been unable to complete the project in roughly 2.5 hours of trying. And, he replaced the front marker light (in the same assembly) in the same amount of time!  In another instance, Shuppe's replaced a radiator they had done once before, nearly 3 years earlier, and was able to convince their supplier to offer a warranty replacement for the parts, charging me only for the shop labor.   I have always found John Shuppe and his office assistant Chris to be honest, sincere, and easy to work with. In fact, in the case of the lamp repair I cited earlier, I had mentally budgeted $200.00 for a job they charged me $47.00 for. I would urge anyone reading the review posted on 2/13/2017 to be mindful that there are two sides to every story."

KRKVx6ZaHl2JyrZNC_NxKA,"As my 1,000 review, I am going to review a home that was dear to my heart for several years. The location where I dated my husband, was a newly wed with my husband, and was pregnant with our first child. We were able to enjoy such a fun lifestyle when living at Optima and I think anyone who doesn't have kids should live in a place like here.   I don't know if you should be allowed to write a review for a condo complex you never lived in and so I felt it was only right for me to write this review as a former resident of the complex and not someone who just visits the common area or looked at one unit with a realtor.   I lived here for several years and loved every minute of it. Location, ambiance and amenities are all tied up into one nice little package here. Of course it's obvious that the location of this complex is perfect because it's walking distance to everything. My husband and I spent years enjoying Old Town Scottsdale on foot and there were some weekends when I didn't drive my car once. You can walk to the mall, restaurants, bars, parks and more. I think it provides the feel of urban living, at least as much as you can feel like you're living an urban lifestyle in Arizona.   As a former resident of Optima, I can say that the amenities were some of the best I've ever experienced. Who needs a gym membership when you have a full gym, indoor pool, indoor basketball courts, indoor racquet ball courts, a putting green and two outdoor pools? It felt like I lived in a resort. To add to the resort feel, we also had a concierge service that would help us make reservations, answer questions, etc. They were always so sweet and I enjoyed stopping in to say hi and grab my packages. Every condo had underground parking which meant that our cars never had to be victim to the horrendous heat during summer months. I never once had to wince while getting into my burning hot car and as soon as I parked, I would take the elevator up directly to my floor and my unit.   The units are all different so I won't review our condo itself, but we loved living in our modern condo and it's perfect for a young couple without kids or a retired couple who wants to be close to everything.   Optima holds a special place in my heart because I lived here during some very important times of my life and what an incredible place to call home during that time!"
jN00dj1opLMyFczkCTptqQ,"Hmmm...It is hard to complain about having an opportunity for a pedicure, but I feel I must share my experience with fellow yelpers. My pedicure was quick, and relatively cheap, however, two other ladies in our group were charged different, higher prices for the same exact treatment, in the same quick fashion. So, watch out for that. Their technicians also demanded payment before their paint was even dry. Mine was much more patient, allowing me time to relax. The place is pretty drab and it would appear that someone ripped most of what decor they once had off the walls. I am usually skeptical of these types of places as I contracted a fungus at one about a year ago, but was pleased to find this place uses the plastic liners in the pedi bath. Also of importance....they will only accept cash for tips, no exceptions to that rule."

3_STYcEwVsieJPo0GWjxLw,"UPDATE (2/14/13):  I haven't been back to King Fong in a year or two.  Unfortunately, my fiance got food poisoning the last time he was there.  I also noticed the cleanliness of the place declining (employees snapping off vegetable stems right in the front \dining room,\"" while also playing on their iPhone).  It really disappointed me, because I used to love it.  Haven't been able to find a place since that really compares.  If anyone learns if this place gets back on track, let me know!  =========== It's basically your typical, greasy Chinese take-out, but you'd be surprised how hard it is to find a Chinese place in the Lakewood area that doesn't taste like garbage.  <restaurant>King Fong</restaurant> is our go-to restaurant.  They're open till 10 PM on Sundays, 10:30 PM on weekdays, and 11:30 PM on Saturdays.  I also love that they deliver, something I never experienced with Chinese food till I moved up here -- I'd been exposed to dine-in or take-out only.  It is about 15-20 minutes faster if you go and order the take-out, though.  We always try to order within at least 45 minutes of their closing, but they seem to take take-out orders up until the last 15 minutes or so.  There is always someone on the phone ordering when we go in to pick up our dinners.  And, if you order a certain amount of food, you get free drinks.  The prices are pretty average, and they offer 2 sizes of most entrees.  The <dish>fried wontons</dish> are the best.  I always get the <dish>chicken lo mein</dish> made spicy, and I love that there are no mushrooms in it.  A lot of the dishes have a good portion of veggies in them, too, so I try not to feel so bad about eating it.    Obviously, this isn't the place to come if you're looking for a gourmet experience.  But for solid Chinese take-out, it's one of the best places around.""",1

They went in to look at mother of the bride dresses and asked to peek at the bridal gown section. Figuring they could take a look around to see if it was worthy of a  visit for me. It was not. But worse then the mediocre selection was the fact that the sales woman was stunningly rude. My mother asked about a gown and was told rudely 'well? Is 7,000 in your budget?' And without my mother being able to answer the sales woman added ' I thought so' Frankly, my mothers budget for my gown is 12,000. And not a penny will be spend in this store. By myself or any women in my family. I will be shopping where my sister got her gowns. She had a beautiful ballgown from kleinfield's for the ceremony and a lovey dropped waist grown for the reception from Amanda Lina's. Save yourself the headache and don't go here.

TTFwX39AlxSebFYUlLR9eg,I can't hate Now for being what it is - Toronto's main independent weekly.  But I have to say that the vast majority of the reasons I pick it up have to do with either being bored or looking up event listings.  Or looking up event listings because I'm bored.  I find the attempts at making local news and Canadian politics both interesting and relevant to a mass audience to be admirable.

Y9N7Bf9n5wrAQ3KYI5W9Dw,"Its funny how suddenly there are good reviews for Toni. She does seem great at first but if you have a problem then her true character shines through. Yes people want cute animals, however families with children want animals who are not aggressive or a threat to well behaved children... Yes Toni keeps a clean place for these animals but she does not check for Giardia (a parasite that cannot be found under a microscope) and considering that my puppy had this when I got her, I am sure that most of the other dogs have it as well. This can infect humans although does not happen often. I would be most concerned with small children in the house because they are constantly putting their hands into their mouths. These parasites will leave your pet without proper nourishment which is extremely important in a growing puppy. Toni also does not socialize the puppies well and puppies need to be socialized the most between 6 and 14 weeks. I am sure that the rescue has adopted out plenty of animals and they have been just fine but for her to assume that any animals who are having issues once in their new home is the people who adopted and not the dog is an ignorant assumption.. As for Toni being straight forward and some people considering that rude... That is not the circumstance of our encounter I am straight forward and She was rude...  Everyone beware.... Toni seems upfront in the start but if things don't go right behavior wise with your dog.. You will quickly see through that...  I am not completely against this rescue, however Toni is not what she seems.  I did not expect to end up with a dog that needs extensive behavior training with a certified behaviorist that would cost me a large sum of money that I cannot afford at this time.. Thankfully someone else stepped in to help until I can do more for our beloved dog... STAY AWAY FROM TONI SHE WILL MISLEAD !! THIS RESCUE TAKES BEHAVIOR CASES THAT OTHER RESCUES WONT.. IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN I WOULD GO TO ANOTHER RESCUE SO THAT YOU LESSEN THE CHANCE OF ENDING UP WITH AN AGGRESSIVE DOG!!! Toni refused to.listen to what i was telling her about the dog we adopted and considering that she was in denial about the dog having fear issues and trying to place the blame on us as though we are not a good family.. This poor animal would have likely been subjected to being returned again or in a home where the people are not so understanding... AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOU PET TESTED FOR EVERYTHING WHEN ADOPTING."

Makes sense since they 'cleaned' the whole house in an hour.   Reason for 2 stars is simply because they are friendly and showed up on time.  Would not recommend.
F_Y0C7vHbie6XwzH0uAJYA,"I had an appointment for 5:30 for a hair cut and upon arrival I was asked to take a seat by the receptionist. I understand that Fridays can be busy, but waiting for 40 minutes when you have an appointment is ridiculous. What is the point of making an appointment? I decided to leave since I cannot tolerate when a business is not considerate of their customer's time. Needless to say, while I was sitting there flipping a magazine, nobody approached me to ask if I had been already helped. When I approached the reception and told them what had happened and said I was going to leave, the answer was ,'ok, sorry about that'. Overall, a very bad experience."
E2Xh5nUmroHqrAJlZxjzDw,I was first introduced to ABA when one of my associates at LinkedIn provided me with contact information. I meet James via a phone call and he made me feel very comfortable about talking with him concerning my business and financial goals. James and I have had many calls and each time we talk I feel as if I've made great headway toward my goals and financial success. I'm not one who easily recommends someone or a business although in this situation I have to say that I have a very high respect for American Business Advocates and if you are looking for help accomplishing your financial goals James is the man to talk with.
aOvEr1tluvkmwZjpzfxBAg,"This specific review in in regards to their catering services & not the truck or the owner (Izzy) himself but his rude a** assistant.   I am having a wedding reception at a local park shelter house where there is no kitchen & thought a food truck would be a fun & smart alternative. So I contacted StrEat Bistro to discuss their catering services. I'll admit, the owner , Izzy) responded quickly & was incredibly enthusiastic about his menu. But since they were opening a restaurant that same night, he didn't have time to go over details & was going to have his assistant contact me.   Well, to put this simply- she's a greedy, arrogant, rushed A**!  Jamie (I think was her name?) was abrupt from the get go. I clearly stated that my fiance & I were not looking for anything special to be made but had gone over the menu they provide on their site & had picked selected items we would like to taste.  Since neither of us have ever visited their food truck, would it be possible to do so. She never answered that question but skipped right over it & instantly tried to push items that were not on their main menu ( & I'm assuming more costly) on me.  Now, I'm pretty open to suggestions & understand the process of up-saling, etc but the way in which she conducted herself was very rushed & pushy. .. Once we got to talking about ME for a change & not what SHE felt should be done, the subject quickly changed to budget.  Through out this entire process, their were too many long & awkward pauses. She then became a bit snippy as if our conversation was a huge inconvenience to her & she had better things to do. I felt unwelcome and stupid :/ When I was finally explaining  that my budget per person was roughly $10.95 to $14.00 (which I don't think is bad. After all it's a food truck where most of their items are under $10.00) she got even weirder on me. Again with the long silence, her response was very similar to this \ Eeeeerrrrr....uuuummmm....yeah. *enter long pause*  I don't know, um..... you're budgets too small... *enter another long pause*I can come up with another menu and call you on Monday or Tues of next week\"". Of course, I knew she was NEVER going to call back just by her attitude & I was right!   On what planet does not putting yourself in debt over catering a sin? I don't think my budget was too difficult to work with (again, most items under $10.00 off of their menu). especially because they majority of guest are small children & are not going to be eating $14.00 plus in food. Seriously- a complete b**ch!  I will never seek out their truck nor their restaurant unless it's to punch her in the face!"""

I like the name of the business and the fact that it's oddly yet conveniently located in Les Cours Mont-Royal shopping center in Downtown Montreal - easily accessible by metro.   First, I had access to my own, private changing room. Why this isn't a thing at every spa is beyond me. The privacy, the cleanliness, the quiet - all a perfect start to my day of relaxation.   I love that in-between treatments, I was offered tea, water, and chocolate-covered strawberries! Yummy.   I had booked a 1.5 hour massage, a wax treatment and a pedicure for around $170. The massage was lovely, the wax treatment was efficient and professional but the memorable experience here was the pedicure. I got it with a paraffin treatment so it was quite pricey but amazing. They envelop your feet in hot pink gel in plastic baggies that continually heats up your feet for about 15 minutes. Afterwards, I got a beautiful pedicure. My feet were so soft and shiny. I would go back just for that.",0

After having my left rotator cuff royally effed up at a yoga class elsewhere in the city (thank you Mr. Yogi that put me in that arm bind that my body clearly wasn't able to do) I needed some serious treatment.  A friend recommended his buddy Dr. Waj Hoda at Totum and as my 4 stars indicate, Yay!  I'm a fan!  Waj is super knowledgeable and thorough.  His treatments of deep soft tissue massage and acupuncture are precise and effective.  This is not a shee shee foo foo massage.  There shall be no nature sounds and flutes playing in the background. He's digging in with his thumbs and elbows and it hurts so good.  You'll feel right as rain in no time.  Appointments are a quick and dirty 20 minutes and will do you a world of good.  As an aside, if I lived or worked in the westend, I'd totally be a member.  Place is stacked.  Not very often you find a really well-equipped gym that has stylish decor and doesn't stink.

ihL-5oPKYwU26gE4eCcAyA,"Stayed in Calgary for a week and was searching for some of the best places to eat in the city, <restaurant>Provision</restaurant> came up on multiple lists, so my partner and I made a reservation.  The restaurant, which is perfectly situated in the city's Central Memorial Park, is cute and cozy and feels as if you're in a cabin in the woods. Super Canadiana chic. When we arrived, there were two other tables currently seated and although we had arrived ten minutes early for our reservation, the waitress was more than willing to accommodate us.   The menu is seasonal and fresh, with a focus on local and organic produce and meats. We ordered the <dish>tuna crudo</dish> ($19) and <dish>beet salad</dish> ($13) to start, and they were bright, fresh and beautifully done. The best way to describe both dishes is simple ingredients, well done.   My partner ordered the <dish>Pacific salmon</dish> ($26) for their main dish and I ordered the <dish>Alberta Pork Chop</dish> ($27) for my main. I found that my <dish>pork chop</dish> was a bit overcooked for my taste, but the warm potato salad was straight up ridiculous. The salmon was perfectly cooked, firm to touch and just delicious.   We were so happy with our meal here and knew if this was the kind of service and food to kick off our journey in Calgary, we were going to be having a great time. Thanks for making our first meal in Calgary so special.",1

The BOGO offer (all day every day eat in or take out)can work in your favor, and sometimes you're not saving anything. Fancy rolls? sure, definitely could use a half off. Generic/veg rolls? No thanks. Yeah, I'm getting half off my <dish>california roll</dish> but they charge $9 to begin with, double what other sushi joints charge, so not really a great steal.

I've tried almost every appetizer and although I don't have a favorite, I also don't have a \never order again\""... though the ginger dressing on the <dish>house salad</dish> is more often than not so bitter it ruins everything, so I usually skip that.   I'd like to go in and enjoy my meal more often, but even when there's only one other table I still can't get my server to pay attention to me, so I'd rather just skip the whole \""service\"" part.

RpRLx2o-a_ZenEP3JjeGGg,"I was actually surprised and impressed with this store after walking in. I came just to sell a longboard that I thought was going to become my next great hobby. Surprise! That lasted about a week and change. At first I thought it would be a pain to sell the thing and planned on just donating it. Good thing I came here because they offered me more than expected and I happily accepted.  As with any other trade-in kinda place they will pay you cash or a higher amount in trade-in value. So I had a look around. They cater more to the popular team and TV sports in the area with more than half of the store. Huge sections dedicated to football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and hockey. There's also a sizable section for weights, weightlifting, running, cycling, home workouts, punching bags, stationary bikes and treadmills. They even had a decent selection of longboards and I almost wish I had come here first instead of buying new online. You can probably find better stuff for lower prices here, making it more worth your while if you're just trying out some new sport.  I may be back in. They have some new things mixed in with the used. They don't buy or sell activity tracker watches unfortunately. But there are plenty of other things to check out and get a deal on. Why buy new when used is just as good in most cases?"
ln_nzyKkxxRyyowiyRkQFg,"I wish I would have seen these posts BEFORE I went to this store and got roped in to all their empty promises.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!  The sales group, especially Rick Jones are the most unprofessional, unethical people not to mention that they are complete liars.  Once you give them a check, good luck hearing back from them.  I started working with them at the end of September and was promised it would be done early November, no problem getting it down by Thanksgiving and yet, here I sit with not even a DATE to have it done.  I am so frustrated and disappointed I cannot even believe they are still in business.  I would definitely not recommend this company!  This is one company I would love to see go under!

PkmvWFGogJk8DlSYuTWBcQ,"I had an absolute excellent experience with J C Welding. Jesus is a professional owner, Oscar is an incredible welder and just a really genuinely nice gentlemen.  My HOA wanted me to put my trash bins in my garage or in my backyard, but I contact J C through Yelp on a Wednesday, and they had installed a brand new gate with privacy screen to conceal my trash bins on the side of my house...and did it all by Friday! And it looked great--everything I asked for.  Oscar did such a good job, I hired him immediately to install a privacy screen and design arch element to my other gate to the backyard. That was done perfect!  I then had some landscaping lights that had broken at the base and needed to be connected. Oscar thought, initially, that they could be welded, but realized at the shop that the base was aluminum and would've melted. So he built a base for the lights and and they are as strong as ever. Oscar didn't have to do that because he is a welder, but he kept his word that he would fix them and he did!  I can't say enough about this team. The reviews speak for themselves and I can say that they are a 5 star company!"

I'm a long-time Jimmy John's fan, but if there was a <restaurant>Jersey Mike's</restaurant> closer to my home, JJ would have some serious competition.   A few minor criticisms: price is a little high compared to Jimmy Johns. The #5 was $7.25 for a regular sized sub  - almost two dollars more than a JJ Vito.

The 1st time was a backyard project with artificial turf and upscale textured paver stone to create a fire pit area with seating for 4. It came in just as we planned and on budget. Very pleased so we called Dave again with our 2nd project, our front yard. In time there will be a 3rd project, our side yard.   As we all know with contractors, there are the worst of the worst and the best of the best and all points in between. Dave is the best and always, always on time and shows up when he says he will. He has plenty of cool options for every budget and there really is no limit to what his work encompasses.   Today Dave is doing a complete redo of our pathetic front yard. These guys are fast & efficient. Dave is very hands on and works every project to insure satisfaction.  We opted with grey river rock, Palo Verde tree, green lillies, Lilly of the nile, Japanese plum and mexican fan grass. This includes tearing out and haul away, full drip irrigation as well as planting and stone work.   Daves speciality is artificial turf. Many options and price points to choose from. The finished project is 100% perfect and on time & on budget. No surprises or gimmicks at all. Dave is very reasonably priced and we got alot of value for the $$ spent.

I called Ramiz and he said to simply bring it back. He even stayed late after his normal end of day to wait for me. Ramiz made the return process smooth as silk, no issues  no questions asked, and made sure the refund would be processed quickly. I would have just exchanged, but they were out of stock on that model.  If you are in the Market for a new Barbecue, or need to replace parts or get accessories, this is the store for you, and Ramiz is the guy to ask for! (I am sure the other guys are great as well), but Ramiz went above and beyond to assist me so I highly recommend him."

The one highlight is they do run weekly specials and one of the nights it's prime rib, and I hear its worth it.  The place is really big and open, there are games, bathrooms need updating, wait staff is nice, security is always around (murder in front of bldg. some time back), and there is a Lobster grabbing machine.  Those are sooooo funny.  I'm not sure how busy it gets at night and my review is only based on happy hour and only trying their food a couple times.

3Uf2n4uLMjbVj5Gw6uaE3g,"When I first moved into these apartments in 2013 aside from the roach carcasses all over the place on move in day things were decent. For a single person with no kids the apartment was spacious, with nice amenities like the water cooler and the gym, and the area was nice and quiet however as time went on I became increasingly more and more unhappy living here. What with unleashed dogs running about the complex, people parking in my parking spot and only getting an orange ticket on their window instead of having their car towed (I paid for the parking spot in my rent), hives of bees always congregating around the mailboxes, and the mountain of fees they tried to impose for random things its a wonder that I stayed so long. Upon my moveout I was told that I would have to pay approximately $350.00 to have the carpet replaced just because I had dogs. Despite me walking my dogs 4 times a day this was in the lease agreement so I didn't argue and I paid it. About a month after I moved out I recieved a $120 bill in the mail for cleaning fees. \Preposterous!\"" I thought. I made it a point (and took a video) to clean the refrigerator,counters,washer and dryer, the stove and the pantry. I even mopped the kitchen and the bathroom. I did not make it a point to clean the inside of the oven nor the bathtub, or get the carpet cleaned (since they charged me $350 to replace it). I didn't clean the bathtub because it was uncleanable without a heavy duty cleaner which I wasn't going to invest in,  and with whatever they painted the tub with before I moved in that kept chipping off and clogging the drain I didn't even bother.  Surely I'm not a cleaning person, so I didn't make it a point to deep clean the apartment as it's customary for the apartment complex to have the apartment fully cleaned before the next tenant moves in. However this fee was passed on to me. It is wholey irresponsible for an apartment to rely on the previous tenant to fully and thoroughly clean their apartment at move out before the next person moves in. Basically the apartment was going to be cleaned anyways so I felt that it was unethical and a dirty business practice for them to still bill me even though they needed clean the apartment themselves anyways. To expect your tenant to make their apartment apartment ready for your new tenant is unacceptable. I don't recommend Villa Fiesta. At one point I would have. Before they charged me unnecessarily even after all of the months that I paid my rent on time, and was a good tenant (no loud parties, no loud music, no overflowing sink etc.) and then they went ahead and decided to treat me this way I won't ever refer these apartments to any one again."""

We approached the first one we saw a little tentatively, not entirely sure that they would be shucking oysters at 10am.  Everyone looked like they were still busy opening shop.

We ended up getting a dozen <dish>oysters</dish> (2 each of 6 varieties) and she quickly and expertly shucked them for us.  (There were a few shards but no one's perfect.)

fxqdFwPIifcO6QwZhzGGAw,"Plan A - Let my eyebrows grow out a bit so I can reshape them.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to let them go?  Well, they didn't fill in the way I wanted, so... Plan B - See an expert.  I had always done my brows myself, but had read about Patricia, the owner of Brow Boutique in a magazine.  She was described as being an expert at finding the perfect shape for each person's face and I thought it was worth a try.  Well, it appears she is so popular that she is regularly booked 1-2 months in advance.  However, after a few calls I was able to fill in for someone else's cancellation. Her shop is about a block from the LV Premium Outlets.  It is a one-woman operation in this very cute space with girly, shabby-chic touches to make customers feel comfortable.  The whole process probably took 30 minutes and I felt completely pampered.  She shaped and tinted my brows for $60 and wow, I love it!  I hadn't thought she would be able to make such a change, but I am very happy with the results and will definitely be returning. If you have never had your brows done, I highly recommend it.  And that goes for the guys, too.  There was a gentleman finishing up his appointment right before mine and I say kudos for being well groomed!"

GCRnrQtGOQ8ugofVbgrS-w,"My wife was super excited when she saw the historic building housing this bakery and cafe. Two stars mostly for price, and limited selection for a spot that bills itself as a bakery. The items on offer were pretty tasty, but neither old fashioned farm style, nor particularly fancy for a shop run by CRMR, and two items cost $7+.  This price tag would be easier to swallow if the nondescript interior of the shop had a rustic atmosphere, like the heritage building that houses it.  Two stars is a bit harsh, I realize it's tough to make a profitable seasonal business out of such a venture, but I was disappointed after going out of the way to try it out. A more apt name like Annie's Snack Shack would set expectations appropriately, and adding a few rustic touches would set the mood better.",1

b1vCw2DJ2bRROqA0aWNqWg,"Statement from the Parent of one of the victims  The level of negligent security as well as the systemic incompetence displayed by James P. Lee, Ed.D. Superintendent Paradise Valley Unified School and his representatives are unconscionable. Thankfully the Arizona criminal justice system has taken seriously these criminal felony offenses that this child has now been charged with.  Who was protecting my child that day at Shea Middle School when a student exposed himself twice in the same school day in front of 70+ students and 3 teachers in the middle of 2 separate classes?  The Teachers?  The Principal?  The School District? ------NOBODY WAS PROTECTING MY CHILD THAT DAY!  We are extremely concerned and alarmed at how the Paradise Valley School district handled a very graphic indecent exposure occurrence at Shea Middle School this 2015 school year.   While we do not believe that the school is responsible for the behaviors of this child, we do hold the school and the school district accountable to their own policies and procedures, which state,   \The Paradise Valley Unified School District places high priority on providing each student with the opportunity to learn within a safe and stimulating environment. For this reason, the Governing Board accepts the responsibility for identifying those behaviors, which, if allowed to exist without restrictions and appropriate disciplinary action, would interfere with individual and group learning and would interfere with the orderly conduct of our public schools. Furthermore, the Governing Board charges the staff with the responsibility for enforcing the rules of conduct, establishing consistency in their enforcement  and maintaining an appropriate learning and behavioral environment.\"" (Paradise Valley Unified School District, Parent/Student Handbook,  2014-2015).    The school and Governing Board have denied the severity of this disorderly conduct/sexual harassment incident, despite the fact that the child who quite graphically exposed himself in two classrooms during one school day has been charged with two class-six felony charges of indecent exposure by the Maricopa County Prosecutor's office.   The child who was charged has a history of escalating behavioral issues at Shea Middle School, including assaulting another student just days before the indecent exposure incident occurred.  The Paradise Valley School district handbook disciplinary chart states that,   \""Multiple offenses in a combination of (misconduct) categories may result in long-term suspension or expulsion.....the following offenses are subject to expulsion on the first offense:  Assault, Disorderly Conduct, and Sexual Harassment.\"" (Paradise Valley Unified School District, Parent/Student Handbook, 2014-2015).      This child was given one week suspension from the school, as the school deemed that it was \""a simple mooning.\""  A \""simple mooning\"" would not have required 8 detectives from the Phoenix Police Department to interview approximately 70 students and teachers to get the actual facts, which have resulted in these criminal felony charges.    It is alarming that an incident of this magnitude can occur in our children's classrooms, and the School and School District representatives have continued to downplay the event. This incident has affected our child and his right to attend a school that allegedly promotes a safe learning environment.  The school has never approached our child as a victim to see how this has affected his emotional status, or how this criminal conduct has affected his learning ability.  He wasn't offered counseling, and he continued to have to attend classes and break times with the aggressive student.  We are appalled that despite addressing this serious issue with the school board, they have not followed the policies that they have set forth to protect our children.  We want other parents to know that this issue is being swept under the rug and that the Paradise Valley School District does not follow the policies that they have set in place in order to maintain conduct within the school.  We are demanding that this aggressive student be relocated to another school that is better equipped to monitor his behavior."""

Fdz1XmiPonomlsZ6KfB6cA,"Its sad that you HAVE to give even one star because I'm done with Autozone. I usually order suspension parts on line from Amazon or ebay because I get top NAME brands, the prices are usually much better, and my status on these sites gains me very fast shipping that has never failed me. So this time, even though the price was a little higher, I decided to order some bushings from my local autozone store at 3920 W Ray Rd. because they told me they would be in by the 17th. On the 17th they had not arrived and I was told it would be two more days. Now, because of my work schedule, I will lose an entire week, not just 2 days. The only option the store gave me was to cancel the order. Great customer service from a company that obviously could care less about their promises OR their customers. I should have known better, shame on Autozone and shame on me.  UPDATE!!! I am a fair person so I am updating this review. Autozone contacted me to tell me they had my bushings so I went ahead and went to pick them up, and even though it DOES NOT REALLY make up for 2 days of unexpected down time, they made the gesture to refund my money and still give me the bushings. I will give Autozone another chance as this gesture was unexpected and appreciated. So I upped my grading to 3 stars since even if this might not have been their fault, they took it on as their problem and did what they could to try and make me happy and I thank them for that."

The door is great quality, with double flaps and a \tunnel\"" between the two walls. He simply uses a superior system than what can be found at big box stores.  And the kicker, based on where I wanted to install the door, there seemed to be some work with electrical, which he quoted as another $50 due to the impending rewiring, etc. Once he tested the walls, George was able to find a way around the electrical, saving me the money. He could have simply gone with what we agreed upon and pocketed the extra money and I would have never know. That's honesty.   Others have made comments about is personality. You pay him to do good work, not become your new best friend. For the work at hand, he delivered."""

NWQ4NpAeGH91DEKTOg2uQw,"The staff at Capital Grill went above above and beyond. But since this is their standard they do it with grace and sophistication without pretension.   I always love the occasion to expose and expand my flavor palate, in combination with the proper education the nuances and deeper elements come through.  Between the staff providing an overview of the wines and the chef description of the preparation and pairings, each taste and morsel individually was amazing, and paired with precision.    This event in 2 words: Elegant Decadent"

nkFOHrBNM5x9hoT7KUNdwg,"My boyfriend and I stopped in for <occasion>lunch</occasion> after parking a bit too far away from the place we were initially heading to-- <restaurant>Jing Thai</restaurant> was the halfway point between our car and the other restaurant, so we decided to step in after checking the menu really quickly.  The menu is absolutely huge, but we ordered one of the lunch specials (they end at 3PM) from the Chinese section of the menu. We each got the first one, which consisted of 4 <dish>sweet and sour chicken balls</dish>, some <dish>chicken chow mein</dish>, <dish>chicken fried rice</dish> (my boyfriend paid a dollar extra for noodles on his), and an <dish>egg roll</dish>. I also decided to get two <dish>Thai spring rolls</dish> since my boyfriend hadn't tried rice paper rolls before.  We got our rolls first, after only waiting a few minutes. Both came with the same sauce, which was a little disappointing because I was expecting a peanut sauce for the rice paper roll, but it was fine. The rice paper roll had carrots, which I've never seen incorporated before, but I thought it was quite yummy. My boyfriend loved his <dish>egg roll</dish>, but I'm not a fan of Chinese 5-spice and I could taste it. Overall, though, the appetisers were good.  Our specials came out almost right after we finished the rolls, and the plates were overflowing with food. I was surprised at how much food we got since I've had specials at other restaurants and they were maybe half of what <restaurant>Jing Thai</restaurant> gave us. My boyfriend loved his <dish>noodles</dish> and his <dish>chicken balls</dish>, but felt that his <dish>chow mein</dish> tasted a bit fishy-- I didn't taste it, but I'm assuming it's the same <dish>chow mein</dish> I had on my plate and it tasted fine to me, he probably picked up on the fish sauce used to cook it. The sweet and sour sauce wasn't disgustingly sweet, and there wasn't too much on my plate which I appreciated. The <dish>fried rice</dish> wasn't dry, and everything tasted the way it was supposed to.   Our bill came out to 27 dollars, which is amazing considering how much we ate. Next time, we'll split a lunch special because we felt like we were going to explode after eating separately, so you might want to consider doing that too. We're definitely coming back, as the food was delicious and affordable, and the staff was so friendly. The interior was nice, too, there were linens and wooden tables and chairs, so it's definitely not just a take-away restaurant.",1
3Z83CmJXyTSBpOzPqcvY8Q,"Being someone who doesn't usually review places- I feel as if after my incredibly awful experience at this establishment I need to warn people about it! I have never died my hair and after much convincing my friends purchased me a Groupon for a couple of highlights at a salon in Yorkville...which turned out to be a nightmare!   This was a horrible experience! I went in with a Groupon I purchased online and came out with probably the worst haircut of my life. The deal I purchased included a treatment, cut, highlights, style/blow dry and a manicure. When I arrived I asked how the night was going and she said she was tired and grumbled at me. After waiting for 30min she asked me what I wanted and I said I had the Groupon. She immediately became angry and started cursing under her breath that this was shit and that she shouldn't have to do this. I then told her I wanted highlights- without asking me what color or where I wanted them she started applying ANOTHER woman's old used color into my hair. I immediately told her I was uncomfortable and she said that it was to bad and that the dye had already started working. I asked if we could wash it our and not do the highlights anymore and she said sure- but if they were ruined she was not going to fix them because she was tired and if I wanted them fixed I could go to Shoppers and get myself my own box of dye. I then became quiet as no one wants to fight with the lady doing your hair. When she began cutting my hair she became angry seeing that I was visibly upset about the dye- swearing and yelling that she \Didn't have to deal with this bullshit clientele from Groupon\"". Then she turned her anger onto me and began badgering me asking if I was going to cry about my haircut. I then did and she yanked my hair back with a brush and said she was finished with this Bullshit.  I left- with hair which now feels like straw/ because of the dye job and a half haircut- no manicure- no style  and pretty horrified by the whole experience MY ADVICE NEVER GO HERE EVER!!!!!"""

For my birthday on March 15, 2015 I wanted a ombre style I have very dark hair and I asked the lady would it be hard to lift me up to a medium to dark blonde I told her I had box dye on my hair I had a red dye on my hair and if she thought that she couldn't get it up to that color then we would just go with the cut I wouldn't even bother to put bleach on my hair she told meit will be no problem to lift you up to that color......well needless to say I was not the color I wanted I was copper red and damaged i beingthe good person that I am and I call back not mad at all very compassionate with the girl that did my hair and asked if she could fix it she said no problem I said please get rid of the orange red brassy hair if you have to tone them darken them just I don't want anymore red well after I left the salon I was even more red and orange then when I came in they told me to contact corporate I did they told me to talk to someone the Melissa I was very happy she answered as soon as I called she got back to me very soon I asked her just for a simple refund of my money she told me it's protocol that I have to go to another salon and try one more time so I went to the Strongsville salon and I told the lady please do me a favor if you have to darken my hair do so to get rid of the orange she's told me again we don't have to darken I will be able to lift you up to the color you want again I came out like carrot top I called back to corporate to talk to Melissa and since two months  she lies and has the girls up front that are answering the phone to say that she's in a meeting and will not answer my phone calls I've left message after message and she refuses to call back!!!!

sBuIOgDbvlub6ljCWJ9tZA,"I love this place and would go here all the time but the parking lot is so small that it is taking me away from shopping here. I can never find a parking spot and usually have to park in the back alley behind and walk around to the front and then I don't have a good shopping experience because I am worried about my car.  I do know that Rachel Notley shops here though as two times that I have been here, she has also been here which takes up a lot of parking as once when I was here she had 4 black escalades outside waiting for her and with the parking lot the size it is- it basically took up all the spots. However, the second time I saw her she only had two with her. There was another time that I managed to find a spot in the parking lot and someone else came and there was no spots for them so they pulled up along the sidewalk and parked there car there in the parking lot and again.. with the parking lot the size it is that didn't work. No one could come in or out to move around the car and I couldn't back out.  I don't really like there payment policy but from a business standpoint I see how it works with making money. I do prefer Plato's closet to this place as it is just too big and takes way to long."

pXlverM0Xn_fq7fpE0EsRg,"Having been a hot yoga junkie in my past, I opted for a student special at this Sanctuary for $ 20. My first class was a Yin Restorative class in a muggy dim cabana reminiscent of a sauna except for a relaxing and repetitive cycle of \Shav Asana\"" or corpse position; Extremely relaxing, restorative except for the fact I'm practicing Yoga to live longer ! Tracie, the instructor, was good and precise in her instructions, however, some feedback on whether I was performing the asanas correctly and in proper form would have been much appreciated. On my second day on the student passport, I met Adina, a spunky and warm instructor with a keen eye for her students. Now, business;The  Hatha Yoga class; A mix of Plank, Shava, Downward Dog, Table positions. Slightly more work than Restorative Yoga but fun, light and again very relaxing nonetheless."""
UfMyADE4CU2LDBnMjUNPkQ,"Golden Acre is Calgary's ode to gardening die-hards. However, more appealing is the fact that you don't even have to be interested in gardening to have a good time in GA. Just sifting through store and the goodies inside is a nice way to kill a couple of hours. The bonus is being surround by what seems like a forest of plants is a very relaxing venture. I feel at peace here.  This place has everything including rows of soil, a plethora of fertilizers, pots large enough to store bodies in (not that I would recommend it), colourful and ugly flowers and plants, patio furniture and a 10 foot knight one could purchase as a piece for the garden. The knight alone make for some good fun and pictures."

CngWlPhEYO8sEJ4h7dBcnA,"Cassie Campbell is truly one of the nicest and most comprehensive public rec centres I've ever visited. Let's see: ice rinks, huge gymnasium, several multipurpose rooms, group fitness classes, indoor track, outdoor tennis courts, large gym with a lot of equipment, lane pool, kiddie pool, large 2 story water-slide...and I'm sure there's a few other things. Hey, there's even a police station attached if that makes you feel even more safe.  I also just love the feel of the place which is very open concept with what must be a 20 ft. ceiling (or taller), full of natural light. It's a few years old now, but shows very little sign of wear and it's very well kept.  My son went to a week-long kids camp here during Christmas break, and it was very well run. He really enjoyed it and it was great that they had such a great facility to take advantage of and allow the kids to be active.  Perhaps having a squash court would make this place lacking virtually nothing; however there's virtually nothing left to critique aside from that. Cassie Campbell (the former hockey player) must be proud to have her name associated with this facility."
fKftHX6lr8JEta7u7Uz-LA,Read the  reviews before stepping a foot inside the PINK BUILDING.I paid them $100 to handle a speeding ticket two weeks before my court date. The never showed up for court and a went into a warrant. Had to pay the court $200 plus the service the PINK BUILDING charges a total of $300 for a speeding ticket that would of cost me $85....The PINK BUILDING is a rip off. Spoke to the owner KIRK about a refund for there services not renduered.All he kept saying is that  I signed a contract. They never fulfilled there end off the contract by going to court....Such a RIPP OFF PLACE.
zoUGIDxPby2YiHTuynyvtA,"We've been going to <restaurant>Bamboo Legend</restaurant> since it opened, many years ago. At first, the food was great, the service was great and we had no complaints. Over the years, the food seemed to go downhill a bit and when we'd order wine, they had nothing left on the wine list except the most expensive wines. We gave up a few years ago and just stopped going.  We decided to give it another try and were pleasantly surprised that the food is once again delicious. The three of us ordered different noodle dishes and other than the lack of spice, we were very happy with them. All were very tasty and the portions were plentiful. We also ordered the <dish>calamari</dish> and the <dish>fish cakes</dish> as appetizers. The <dish>calamari</dish> was very tasty, as was the dipping sauce. The <dish>fish cakes</dish> were some of the best Thai <dish>fish cakes</dish> we've had. They were cooked just perfectly, rather than being a little overdone and rubbery as is often the case.  Our only real complaint about the food was that it wasn't very hot. Everything was warmer than room temperature, but not as piping hot as it should have been.  The main reason for my 3-star review instead of 4-star was that the service was just terrible. We were told to sit wherever we wanted to, but sat for at least 5 minutes before getting menus. Then we waited at least another 15 minutes for the server to come back over to take orders. He didn't even mention drinks, just said \okay, what do you want to order?\"". No apologies were offered for the time we had waited.   A table came in while were were sitting. They waited 15 minutes and walked out. We also heard others complaining that they had been waiting too long for service and heard the server apologize several times to others.   The restaurant wasn't overly busy, but there was only one server and I think that was the problem. Once we put in our orders, the food came out fairly quickly so it wasn't a problem with the kitchen.  Having said all that, the food was good and we will most likely be going back. We've also ordered take out once since that visit and the food was just as good and piping hot.""",1
lwrGGiBSB7TCeaTBNO2MEA,"Having spent 44-years in the military and higher education it was time to come home to Ohio.  I did some research on communities in and around the Cleveland area and knew that the Aurora, Hudson and Solon area was of great interest due to low crime rates, availability of shopping and more importantly outdoor activities.  After selling my home in Vermont I spent my first day in Ohio looking at apartments. The most important issues for me were security, a garage and easy access to the area.  I found all those and more when I visited the gated community of Residence at Barrington in Aurora.  Having visited several other complexes', I knew when I walked into the Leasing Office at Barrington and was greeted by Robert Green and a wonderful staff that I was in the right place.  Their professionalism was top-notch, as is that of the maintenance staff whom I've met.  The apartment I was shown was clean, neat, will appointed and offered all the things that were important to me.  The complex has a wonderful pool, fitness and business center.  My neighbors are great and due to the design of the apartments noise is almost non-existent.  A supermarket, restaurants and even a movie theater are all within walking distance.  It has been a long time since I've lived in an apartment and I could not be more pleased.  The Residence at Barrington would be a wise choice for anyone looking for a quality apartment and a great place to live."

jzveTy7ogH7cg9axZ78ENg,"We love the downtown location (we visit it every once in a while) and were very excited to see the <restaurant>Koyoi</restaurant> name in North York when we drove past it the other day. We had to go give it a try!  It was a very early <occasion>dinner</occasion> on a Friday night, we arrived at the place just 15 minutes after 6pm. The place was pretty empty which made sense with the time and that I felt that it probably just opened in the last few weeks (or days?) or so.   The service was like what we would experience from the downtown store - got our water pretty quickly and they'd always refill without us even have to ask. (But then it wasn't that busy at the time of course.) In fact, I think I recognized one of the waitresses to be from the downtown location.  Very much to our joy the menu was very similar (if not almost exactly the same) as the one downtown - they've got the <dish>koyoi salad</dish>, the <dish>beef tataki</dish>, <dish>spicy fries</dish>...and then we realized there wasn't a \fried\"" section. This was a bit of a let down because we absolutely LOVE their <dish>karaage</dish> (japanese fried chicken), with lemon/salt or with nanban-style with tartar sauce. The waitress said they don't have the fryers installed yet - so we really hope that'll happen some time soon.   Other than that, the food tastes great, the same as what you'd get from the downtown store. There was only two of us so we didn't eat a whole lot, just our regulars that I've mentioned above. We also had their <dish>okonomiyaki</dish> for the first time since we kind of lacked hot food without the fried stuff (and we didn't feel like any rice or udon dishes). It was decent and had some seafood in it. I can't really comment because I've only had this from the Okonomiyaki House downtown before.   They have a pretty good drinks menu with beer on tap, bottled beer, cocktails, sake, umeshu, chuhai, etc. Their 650ml Kirin price is the same as downtown and we love that.   All in all, although there wasn't as many food options as the downtown store, I guess I could understand since they called this one \""Bar Koyoi\"" instead of downtown's \""Restaurant & Bar\"". A pretty decent place for having some drinks. Would definitely visit again unless we happen to be downtown. Really hope they get those fryers!""",1
1_4vi3UZW-Cb__Gp6gkBQA,"Absolutely the worst business I have ever been to. The owners are useless, they don't answer their phone and have no clue as to what is going on in their place of business. On their website and on their door they have stated that they are only closed on Tuesdays, but I have come to the store 6 TIMES now on every other day but Tuesday and the doors are locked. Then when I call the owner and he eventually answers, he says \oh really? We should be open.\"" I then proceed to give them another chance and visit the following day and the same thing happens.

We brought him in for a nasty ear infection. Dr. K and the tech were wonderful!!! They were very calm and compassionate with him. They didn't jump into a muzzle or meds, but tried to work with our dog by building his trust. They were able to do what they had to do to get him feeling better without drastic measures! They were so patient and kind! We didn't feel rushed even though the waiting room had pets waiting to be seen. Cost was very reasonable and we will definitely be back! The staff was warm and friendly and the facility was very clean! Very pleased with our visit!"

Well most people who start off dieting just eat half, and take the rest home. The trick is not to eat it later I found. LOL  <restaurant>Quiznos</restaurant> has nice variety of different bread, and the toasting is a nice change from the same old, same old.  So, if UR like me.

QzoHxxiHH1HDOATbMK4odw,This Giant Eagle is located in such a secluded place. The outside looks a wreck. One side of this place looks like it's been blown up or bombed or something. There's like 3 cars in total in the parking lot. The groceries are fresh. The very positive thing about this place is that there are no lines.
ZKQzDL2NB1Q6vxdT6FhSEw,"First off, Curry's moved from Market Village (on Kennedy) to Downtown Markham (on Enterprise), right in the Cineplex mall, in summer 2016.  All the older reviews were for the old location.  I never stepped foot in the old location, so I can't compare this store against the old location.  Nieces wanted acrylic paints as Christmas gifts, so I came by.  The location was very convenient.  There was free parking in private lot, but parking spaces could be scarce.  The store was pretty big in size.  I inquired at the front counter, and one of the gentlemen walked me to the paint section.  There was a huge selection of paints.  Oil paints, watercolour paints and acrylic paints were all here.  Some were in tubes, and some were in bottles.  A novice like me could get lost here.  I purchased some paint+brush sets as they looked like decent Christmas gifts.  They were budget-friendly, too.   There are other types of art and craft supplies.  I think many things here would make decent Christmas gifts for young children to teenagers, even adults if they are into art and painting.  They are wonderful gifts that inspire and nurture creativity."

The first 10 minutes was standing in line, the next 15 was waiting for food. When the food finally arrived, it wasn't anything spectacular. Also, the tartar sauce tasted funny.

We tried our first live octopus here - far cheaper than other locations around Toronto. Worth the try if that's what you're looking for - although in my opinion, not really anything special in terms of taste.   One downside is that the rooms in the far back left of the restaurant are somewhat fly infested at times. We've had to change seats out of there because of the immense about flies.

F9d_0hkJodk_mjcVmfuKrg,"I ride by the Redpath factory every day. Twice. One day i noticed a little wee sign saying \Musuem\"". Hmm... museum you say? I'm curious. A museum about sugar?  My friend and I were both curious and stopped in one day on our way home from work. It was a Sunday and they weren't open but they gave us the hours so we could come back when they were open.  So we returned the next day after work, parked our bikes at the bike rack out front and headed in, not really sure where we were headed.  Inside the main door is just a small security desk. The guard asked us if we had an appointment.  Nope. We told him we had come just yesterday to ask when they were open and were told we could come back today. The flyer he gave us with the hours said they'd be open and didn't say anything about needing an appointment.  After a phone call and a few minutes of confusion, we were escorted to the back of the building and told to walk towards a guy wearing a white lab coat at the back of the property. He stood back there with a wide stance and his arms crossed in a strange intimidating way. But when we got up close, he was just an odd white hairded, mutton-chopped older man with a fun British accent. He showed us into the Museum and told us that he was just finishing up with a group of seniors (weird?) and then we would have the place to ourselves.  The displays were really nicely put together, going over the history of John Redpath and how he came to Canada and first started his businesses.  Once we really got reading about him, it was pretty interesting. The strange museum man would pop in and out every once in a while to see if we had any questions. My only question was if they ever did tours of the actually factory so i could see how sugar was really made. He said they didn't do that because it's a food production factory and everything is all sealed up for health standards. Darn.  It was a strange afternoon at the Redpath Museum, but a fun little piece of Toronto (and Montreal) history."""

Basketball, corn hole, and eventually bocce ball on the patio. No food, except for some small bites, and food trucks stopping by on weekends. We were told plans for an adjacent building are to be a combination market, coffee bar and pizza place. We're excited to see what happens!

F3oDNZGUJBIHHy4wQ5jRGw,"I totally understand the two star rating!  I'm LIVID and FUMING.  I ordered a <dish>peanut butter & hot fudge sundae with crunch coat</dish>.   After being hollered at via drive thru HUH HUH HUH three times I spoke louder and she told me we don't have crunch coat.  I asked then to have sprinkles with a little tiny bit or nuts to make it like crunch coat.  SO I pulled around as I pulled around I was almost struck by a car reversing I'm assuming cause there order was messed up.  I paid for my sundae which she grabbed my payment with her gloves on which is gross since she will still touch food with those money handling gloves and because the car in front of me had mistakes in the order I double checked mine and mine was wrong.  I had to beep my horn and knock on the window and kindly says mam I asked for peanut butter I was already a little annoyed I was charged for sprinkles AND nuts rather than since they are out of the crunch coat and it was 12 Spanish nuts just do half and half but then she handed the sundae back to be and just pumped peanut butter all on top of the sundae rather than make a new one and I was a little upset when she handed it to me like that cause I am an elite yelper wanted to take a photo but it looked awful.  Now is when I realize I also wasn't given napkins but it poured all over me when I opened it. And it's not like it melted. I parked on the lot to eat it.  Rather than remake the sundae she poured it to the brim and my pants and brand new BRAND NEW $90 nikes are stained!   And she was not happy me and the car in front of me both had issues!   This is awful!   I seriously am so angry.  I work so hard for my money and my pants are salvageable but I can't get the stain outta my shoes and I can't express how lazy and careless this women is and it's the STORE MANAGER.  If the owners are reading this I suggest u have secret shoppers go in and handle this.  The young man Brandon or Brando felt awful and offered me napkins and asked if there's anything he can do seeing me covered in product!   LIVID!  (Excuse errors I'm speaking texting this). But this is the type of employee who if a guest orders a burger no tomato and returns saying they're sorry but they are allergic to tomatoes this type of employee will go back and just pull the tomato off and give patron burger then then patron will die from an allergic reaction.  Just plan lazy!   She did not care at all it was dripping all over me!  I told her very frustrated \you should made a new sundae to compensate that there was obviously no room for more sauce\"" and she was furious I made that statement!   I would love compensation but will never get it judging by the 2 stars!  I almost wanna pay a homeless person struggling for money to picket outside with a sign I'm so mad how I was treated...""",1

After selecting the package and completing the paperwork, he advised us that we would probably get a call the following day to pick up the remains of my deceased dog.  We dropped off my dog in the morning and about 3pm the same day we received a call that everything was ready.   I chose the Remembrance Package.  When we picked up the remains, they were sealed in a box with a certification on the front. I also received a small envelope with some of my dog's fur and multiple cards with my dog's footprint. These items were enclosed in a velvet bag with a very nice saying embroidered on the front of the bad. The lady who assisted us was very kind. She shared the story of losing her cat and how her daughter grieved for 3 weeks. It was a very emotional situation.  When this type of service is needed, I would highly recommend them to anyone."

She's very accommodating and tries to everything to help out your situation unlike the past in my experience. There's plenty of parking, very quiet neighbors, beautiful scenery even though your very close to 51 885 and 43 you don't hear a thing. What I love about this place is that there's trails for you to go on with your dogs that they have no weight limit which is a big plus for me since I have a Newfoundland. The staff there is absolutely wonderful. Ed who is maintenance adores my pooches and says hi to me all the time. They come immediately for everything. The downside though for me right now is the air conditioning unit. It's not powerful enough to cool down enough on the 3 bedroom. But I was rest assured that TAY is handling it. She handles issues right there and then even if it's little. The pool hours are great there open late so when you have to work you don't have to miss out. Also the fact that the gym is open 24 hrs is wonderful you can go at 330 in the morning if you wanted to. We're moving down to a two bedroom and we did have confusion but tay and corporate worked with us accordingly. In my opinion they definitely stepped up there game since last year that's also including ed and bill who are the maintenance.

wUR-kBqRqnvtjMW89m4UpQ,"Very frustrated with this place. I recently moved to the area and wanted to bring my puppy in. He LOVED his day care place back in Wisconsin and wanted to find a place just as great here. I reached out to Camp Bow Wow about bringing him in. I checked their website and made sure I had all of the requirements for him and filled out the application so that I could do an interview for him. I called to schedule the interview. I told them I had all of his vaccine records, they were all up to date and we were ready to go. I told the person on the phone that he was 5 months old and therefore not neutered yet (he hasn't lost all of his puppy teeth and we were advised to wait a little longer in case they needed to pull any of the remaining puppy teeth, which can be a common issue. Then they could do both at the same time and only have to put him under once). I was told they don't accept any dogs that are not neutered. I mentioned that their website said the youngest they accept is 4 month old and any dog older than 6 months must be neutered, so he should be able to come. I was told that they were waiting for corporate to update their website and they no longer accept any dogs that aren't neutered. You should really get the website updated or accept the dogs. I will be taking my business elsewhere because I refuse deprive my dog of going to day care two to three times a week because he's younger. He loves to play with other dogs and I hate leaving him home while I'm at work because it's not fair to him.   I will just be going to a different day care place."

It's a great addition to Greenway Station's restaurant offerings and Middleton's sub scene as a whole. The clean surroundings, fresh-cut meats & cheeses, crisp veggies and friendly service make the sandwiches worth the longer wait than you'll experience at nearby Subway or Milio's or down-the-road Cousins, but at just a fraction of the wait than Firehouse Subs a few exits down the Beltline.

Make no mistake: If you're a New Jersey hoagie or Philly cheesesteak snob, you're not going to like my 4-star review of this place.

_-OBx0-ReIMrPOmaReB8-Q,"I live right down the street from this pub but every time I go in here, I get treated like I'm not a local and I'm not good enough to be there. The first time I came here was 2 years ago- the food was nothing special and the service was very slow. They don't check on you to see if you need anything and it takes a long time to get your food even though they are never busy. I decided to give it a second chance a couple months ago and this time it was even worse. My boyfriend and I sat down at a table and got completely ignored for about 15-20 minutes. The place is tiny so the staff walked by constantly, but they wouldn't even make eye contact with us. It wasn't busy at all but we gave them the benefit of the doubt and moved ourselves to the bar so that we could just order from the bartenders. The bartender ignored us and only helped the couples to the right and left of us. It's like they were going out of their way not to serve us. After waiting at the bar for another 15 minutes and not once being greeted or acknowledged in a total of 30 minutes, we left and we will never be back. You would think they would treat what few customers they have left with some decency.",1

Kn72wEO-qb5ecyFoFpTNNQ,"Came here to see a film with my husband about Jane Jacobs. The owner had a long intro where he talked a bit about his experiences and how his life intertwined with Jacobs for a brief moment in time. It went into some politics and his thoughts on the state of affairs. His intro was quite long, but I rather enjoyed it. Definitely don't think it is an experience for everyone, but I had an open night and no expectations.  The space was intimate, a dark room with a handful of office desk chairs. It was different. I liked it.  Didn't use the bathrooms, so can't rate them on this review."

When I arrived there were 4 people in line and only 1 person working. I saw the sign that said Express Pick Up so although I felt bad for going ahead of the other customers I went there and stood but was not acknowledged.  After about 5 minutes I asked the young man preparing the <dish>subs</dish> if my pickup order was ready and he replied he did not receive an order.  I had an email receipt that said the address was 35522 N. Scottsdale Road so I asked if this was it, but was told the address was on Cave Creek Road. I was not aware of another <restaurant>Subway</restaurant> near there but I went to my car and entered the address in to GPS and it brought me back to where I was. When I went back in there were still 3 customers in line and by the time I got served 45 minutes had passed from the time I first arrived at the store. When I asked the employee why he had not received my order, he stated that his boss gets them but does not let them know about it so it does no good to order online.  Also, when I got to the store the 2nd time I noticed that the street number on the store is 34522 not 35522.  What a way to run a business!!",1

-_vMcLccKfH-3UuXogxiHQ,"Dropped by LiV Yoga Studio on a Snowy Sunday evening for LiV gentle class. The studio was so dark.. I almost think that it was not open because of Super Bowl :)   I did not realize that I have to be so quiet even when I am at the doorway taking off my boots. It was so dark, I cannot even read any signs posed on the door..   Whispering Whispering, feel like I am in a conspiracy.. or I am dealing with something illegal.. Hey I just want to take a yoga class! :P   Personally, I do think they really need to do something with the space.. just using a curtain to block off the practise room does not really work... I can't imagine how they can keep the heat just inside the practise area..   The practise room itself is quite nice.. high ceilings, dim lighting.. and yes that disco ball! Unfortunately, the disco ball was not used in my class. The Yin class with reduced heat by candle light was A-OK... Wish the instructor will give more adjustment. .there weren't any!  They do offer more hip yoga classes like with Live DJ or Hip Hop music! This is good if you want something more nontraditional! :)   Passport of Prana is welcome here.   Parking are free if you come on Sunday the whole day or Weekends after 6 pm.. either park on King or closer to the Liberty Market Place."

uqkqTck9OS-yi_nzjpE1zQ,"ABC Supply Co violator of Maricopa County, AZ, P-21 Diesel Idling Ordinance:  On 4/27/2017 a very large, long flatbed truck from ABC Supply Co., parked in the center of the road right outside my residence and left the diesel engine running. (I suffer from MCS, (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity,) and diesel fumes are a trigger.) After 30+ minutes with the engine idling, I crossed the road to speak to the driver who was operating a forklift truck unloading palettes of paving stone. Once I had the driver's attention, I asked him why he was idling the engine and he was immediately belligerent and aggressive starting with a lie; \Bro, that's how diesels run. They run hot,\"" then with a distraction accusing me of also being a polluter by driving a vehicle, (I drive a two door Toyota Yaris,) and then ending with a racial and prejudicial slur telling me to \""go back to where you came from.\"" (I am a US Citizen with a non-US accent. The driver appeared to be Hispanic.)  I called and spoke with Ian Scott at ABC Supply Co HQ who initially refused to give me the name and address of the company CEO until I pointed out that he was deliberately impeding my complaint by withholding information he had just stated was public. Ian Scott requested that I photograph the license plate so that he could track down the local ABC Supply branch office, which I did. At this point the driver had called his boss who had instructed him to park the truck away from my home and cut the engine.  I filed an on-line complaint with Maricopa County and received a phone call from a County rep. thanking me for the thoroughness of my complaint application. She did indeed speak with the local ABC branch manager and the manager called me to tell me that they would \""handle my complaint internally\"" and \""retrain drivers\"" about idling their fleet unnecessarily in accordance with the law.   Not only is it astounding that this company would run a fleet of diesel trucks with no knowledge of Maricopa County air pollution laws, but the manager refused to accept my request that the driver apologize for his aggressive and prejudicial behavior in writing. CEO Keith Rozolis also ignored my mailed complaint letter.  Please don't support a company who willingly and knowingly air pollute with toxic diesel trucks and who have no issue with aggressive, lying and prejudicial drivers."""

3C0gL4CHLATs2pLGvmptEQ,"I was recently in Phoenix with my husband for business. Although our hotel had a workout facility, I prefer classes over treadmills. We love our YMCA so I thought I would find a local YMCA near our hotel. Chris town YMCA was the closest and I could visit 5 times for free. I got a copy of their class schedule. Total Body Conditioning was listed! Perfect! At home, this is a 45 class that whips my butt weekly. We work every muscle group plus add cardio and by the time class is over, I am dripping wet. But I've learned that not all YMCA's are alike- nor are the classes- even though they are called the same thing. I realize now that Phoenix is a huge retirement community. I was the youngest by far of anyone in the class. It didn't start on time, it lasted 1 hour and when it was over, I did not need a shower! We did a lot of work on our balance- which is important I suppose in your 70's. I'm not trying to be rude- the people were very friendly and kind. It just wasn't the experience I was expecting. Needless to say, I did not go back. If you are 50 or under, fit and active and looking for a place to work-out while in the area, look elsewhere."
t6MiDm0QpgH2FsXLmz7fdA,"In the past two weeks I have had the absolute WORST experience of my life with Chase Bank.The short story is DO NOT BANK WITH CHASE!   Last week right before I was leaving to go on vacation at 5am I used my card to fill up my gas. It declined three times before I called to figure out what was wrong. After a 10 min. wait to talk to someone they said they cancelled my card. NO ONE  contacted me. The lady was so rude. She said that there was nothing I could do except wait for the card in the mail. (Erin from San Antonio calling center) Or I could call EVERY SINGLE time I made a purchase while I was on vacation. How inconvenient is that?! Who wants to call every 10 minutes, and then wait a half hour to talk to someone to get a charge approved? No one! I asked her for a direct number to call so I wouldn't get the run around on the customer service menu. She told me the number but I was driving so I asked her if she could email me the number. (Reasonable request right?) NO she told there was NO email in her office. I asked if she couldn't email me, or if there was absolutely no email at all in her office. Erin then replied that there was NO form of email in her office and there was nothing she could do. Imagine that, Chase National Bank with no email at all? What a liar, I get emails all the time from Chase. So I went in saying how that seemed completely ridiculous and theres no possible way that was true. I asked if she never got any departmental emails, or her work schedule sent to her... again she said NO. After talking to this hyaenas woman she transferred me to someone else while she stayed on the line. Cindy got on the line and the first question I asked was if she email in her office. Her answer was simple and sweet YES. So of course I was immediately furious. Cindy followed up by saying they were not allowed to email customers directly but the damage was done. I understand the rule completely but for Erin to lie over and over seemed so disrespectful like I am so stupid to believe you don't have email?! After the fact Erin could not even admit she had lied. I told her I would not move forward discussing the original reason why I called until she could admit she had lied. She didn't for another half hour until I got hung up on! The entire call Erin kept talking over me and was so so so rude. I thought that was the worst customer service ever! However I was wrong.  It is a week and a half later and I have not received my new card. (Go figure) so I had to call Chase once more. The guy named Derek told me to get a new card I'd have to wait 5-7 business days or go into a chase store and wait 15 min for a new card. I explained to him that the card should've already been at my door so I did not want to go all the way down to the branch to fix THEIR mistake! he said thats ok then it will take 5-7 business days. I asked if there was any way to get the card sooner. He said NO. All I could do was go down to the branch. After going back and forth about the poor quality of customer service he said there was a 2 day shipping option but it would cost me $5. (So he lied. There was another option) I explained to him that I shouldn't be charged for my card getting shipped when they had already shut down my card for almost two weeks.He told me there was nothing he could do to remove the charge. He said once the charge was made I could call back and have the charged removed. I told him I DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY AT ALL and I would not trust them to take off the charge at a later date. Besides whats the difference between taking the charge off, and never charging me to begin with? He said well let me see what I can do... He then said he found away to remove the charge on his end. (Again another lie, he knew how to do it and just told me there was nothing he could do.)  So now my card will hopefully be here in two days but if I am not sitting at home all day waiting to pick it up UPS will not leave it at the door, I will then have to go pick it up from the store.   Moral of the story DO NOT BANK WITH CHASE unless you want to be lied to over and over, spend hours on the phone talking to disrespectful \customer service\"" agents who can not do anything, have your money held hostage, and want to pay money to have Chase fix their own mistakes. I can't believe that these are the idiots I have been trusting with my money. Needless to say I will be closing my account and banking with someone who is smarter and has a caring customer service team."""

But overall, great texture and flavour in the <dish>rice rolls</dish> and they are also very generous as well. I believe the avg roll is around 3.99 with specialty rolls being 5.99.

DxHiH_GFh21dvbaM5qKUgA,"I just moved to Phoenix and had the misfortune of having to stay in this place for my first three months here. Thankfully I have moved on. The staff is great. They are mostly polite and will help you with your needs. The property is kept clean and the courtesy officer is nice and helpful. Parking is plentiful and the bus stop is right in front of the property. Everything is close by including a supermarket, BKs, McDonald's, and Pollo Loco.   Thank being said now I move on to the reason I am only giving this 2 stars: The location. This is NOT in a good neighborhood. I must warn you that if you plan on staying here be prepared to deal with the worse of the worse type of people that Phoenix has to offer. All kinds of riff raff plague the area including but not limited to: homeless people with mental problems, drug addicts, drug dealers, alcoholics, thugs, prostitutes, and the like. I under no circumstances went out at night. NOT a safe place for children and women. While I was there the room next door to mine had a man who was beating up his girlfriend, a drug addict who would let very rough-looking drug dealers stay with him until they were forced out, and a prostitute who would bring clients over. Ghetto people everywhere. One night a crackhead tried to break into my room and started yelling and cursing at me and the police had to be called. I would often see doo-rag wearing thugs who were obviously not staying there walking through the corridors at night when the staff has gone home. Shady people loitering in corners and getting into cars driven by even shadier people. Men covered in tattoos who looked like ex-cons. You have been warned. NOT for the faint of heart.   Also apparently the rooms share a common ventilation system and my room was mired in smoke from whatever the heck the other guests were smoking which I think was in many cases not tobacco (use your imagination). My last day there I had to wash ALL my clothes and used up almost an entire bottle of febreze to get the disgusting smell of smoke out of my clothes. I also noticed burns on the blanket they give you that looked like they came from a crack or meth pipe. Ugh.   Now I'm not saying don't stay here. If you do stay here don't come alone if you are a woman. Expect to be harassed by panhandlers. For goodness sakes if you have children don't go there. Finally don't stay there for more than a month."

V-FlfE9COEQkiWKMdLimIg,"The clerk I had, in response to the review below, was actually very nice and appreciative.  For a schlock store, this place could make better use of space - there are a lot of empty areas.  However, what is occupied has a good selection of stuff.  I found a nice pair of shoes for $30, a flannel shirt for $11 and some miscellaneous household goods.  It seemed better than the Sear Outlet store in South Etobicoke.  I would suggest sticking to boxed household items and clothing as the larger items such as furniture seem to be mostly damaged goods (and not that much of a bargain, for that matter).  This is attached to a small mall hosting the popular Congee Queen restaurant in its lot, but I did not have time to really look around there."

Not only did they have it, but they said they could install it in the ten minutes before the ride's departure.   I think it only took Brian five minutes to put it on.

The vanilla ice cream doesn't have a trace of vanilla or milk taste, and the dip is so sweet it burn my throat, I even doubt they use real chocolate for the dip because it is chewy and not crunchy like other franchises like DQ.  If you don't care much about flavours and just want something soft and cold and taste like refine sugar, it is a good place because it is so cheap. But I rather spend more money on some really ice cream."

After multiple phone calls and messages along with a certified letter stating the problems over months we still have not been contacted.   Great sales door to door with a Segway!! No service.  We continue to get a bill and calls about paying the bill but still no follow up about our concerns.   Do not believe these people!! Do not use this company."

After waiting an hour, we gave up and went to an urgent care where we were seen within 10 minutes. This happens every time we have tried to use them. Nothing minute about this clinic. They spend more time collecting insurance information than patient care. Why when they know that most physician offices are closed on Sunday and they will be slammed as soon as they open, they do not staff another nurse, or at least have a clerk take insurance information so the wait is less."

8mAoDHxJwd3_GgiM7KbTWQ,"GROUPON USERS PLEASE REMEMBER TO BRING VENDOR NO. My daughter purchased 2 season passes from Groupon back in March. She gifted them to me   but I was not able to locate the email. I did however have the paperwork confirming the order, showing proof of purchase, date of purchase and how much we paid. So I called ahead of time to find out what I needed to redeem our passes. I spent 10 minutes going over everything I needed with an employee named Katlin. I like to call ahead of time because I hate getting someplace and getting the run around or the embarrassment of not being prepared. Feeling confident that I had everything with me and gaining reassurance from Kaitlin I decided to bring my son in on Saturday. When I arrived, I showed up with everything that was discussed. One problem. I was missing a vendor number. This is needed in order to redeem your deals purchased from Groupon. Although Katlin was kind and tried her best to take care of the situation I was still feeling let down and irritated that here I was looking like a fool with my son and husband while everyone is having a great time. At one point Katlin called up Steve the manager because everything she tried still wasn't working. Steve actually made things worse, he made me feel like I did something wrong and I felt very uncomfortable, like I was bothering him. It was awkward. Katlin's customer service skills were outstanding. She was excellent with keeping me informed and she kept her cool the entire time.

UCd_VOd2wBtr6XJPM9L7PA,"Fortunately our friends showed up early at this new pub on Wellington street and we got the best and most comfortable table in the house. Remember, it is at back of the pub, just next to the kitchen. Half an hour later the pub was packed and finding any table would have been impossible. Only the bar seats were still available after 7pm. My friend and I focused on beers as we were not hungry, but the rest of our group had <dish>burgers</dish>, <dish>fish and chips</dish>, and the delicious <dish>french fries</dish> and they were satisfied. Anyway, whatever came out of the kitchen smelled great and looked appetizing. Back to the beers list, it is amazing, there are number of visiting beers from different local breweries, we are truly impressed with the effort to offer such a variety. We were also hugely impressed with the service, our hostess was the best, very considarete, professional and efficient. The second floor is dedicated to sports fans, due its to huge screen and I can foresee some hockey nights happening this winter at <restaurant>Le Trefle</restaurant>.",1

qdmfAuH5Vohub06LtB9ZgQ,"Sorry Jesse had such a bad experience here.  I have been using this place for about, well,  from the week they opened as it is so close to my office.  They have never lost or damaged any of my clothing, and I drop my wife's delicate stuff off here as well for dry cleaning.  They have also always been true to their word on when I can pick up my clothes - although I am usually days late on the pick-up (one benefit of being a clothes-horse I guess).   Two doors down from Dunkin, so fantastic to drop and pick the rags and then grab a cup o'joe before hitting the office.  The women who work there aren't too hard on the eyes, either, which is always a plus.  Hard to believe they are still using a dot matrix printer, but that has no impact on service."

I asked if she could take it from the back of my hand, which most phlebotomist shy from since they are smaller veins, smaller needles and a slower process but she didn't hesitate.

Hear you out, then tell you that you are so very wrong.    I've been to this place dozens of times, perhaps fifty or so, with my family, by myself and shopped for and/or bought clothing, boots, ski stuff, fly-fishing stuff.  I've left some money there, okay?  So, I thought maybe I'd let the dust settle over the most recent disgusting bit of retail chicanery, and give the shop another try.  I tie my own flies, for the most part, and when I decide on a new pattern like to have one that was professionally tied to use as my model, for scale, color, texture, all that perhaps important stuff.  So back I go, to the lonely little outdoor store and head over to the fly display.  Then, I see the prices.  I had chosen eight fly patterns.  The least expensive was more than I've ever paid for the MOST expensive fly.  Guy comes over, \Find what you need?\""  Yeah, seeya.

The <dish>focaccia bread</dish> was grilled to perfection. We got the order to go and it was still super hot when we got home! Tasty sandwich with a TON of meat in there!  <dish>Chicago style Vienna all beef hot dog</dish> ($2.75)~ Very good dog with all the fixings.

wIHu6_TeSgfbgUUoiQ-Sxg,"They will nickle and dime you when you move out. I was charged $80 for cleaning when I left the apartment clean. She then discounted it to $40, but then I found out from a friend who still lives there that they are remodeling all of the apartments. If you're remodeling there was no need to even charge me $40. I added pictures of some of the issues I encountered here, including sewage in my tub and stagnant water from rusty/dirty PVC pipes on the property. I should have gotten close to my entire deposit back based on the issues I encountered there.   Police are always on property, not for patrols. Cars have been broken into, my friends car has been several times. Her apartment was also broken into. She complained to me about how her unit had black mold in it and they dragged their feet to repair it. In my unit the roof started leaking and they waited almost a month to fix it. I had a gaping hole in my ceiling for almost a month, and when they did fix it it was half assed. I constantly had to call the police because of domestic disturbances. This apartment is supposed to be drug and crime free, yet when neighbors are beating their spouses and police come it takes other neighbors having to go to the office to ask why they are still here for an eviction to take place. Even though they get a report on when the police are called and why.   They decided to spend massive amounts of money on concrete pots instead of buying new washer and dryers. The ones they have now are constantly broken.   You have to keep your drains covered or run water in the sinks to prevent roaches from coming up. I used paper plates and forks so I didn't have to wash dishes often, because of that the pipes were dry making it so roaches could come up. Disgusting.   They are high in price for very little amenities. If you like action: seeing police, watching neighbors make alleged drug deals (guy waiting in the parking lot several cars meet him and leans in for a few seconds then they leave), etc this is the place for you. As someone else stated, rent is increasingly exponentially.  They only have like one maintaince guy for the whole complex, which is bull. So that means if you need a repair you'll be waiting forever.   Office management rotates constantly. Their home office in Dallas doesn't care about tenants that have been there for years. If you have people who have been there 10, 15, 20 years leaving that should be a red flag, but it isn't.   Look elsewhere.  When my tub backed up with sewage. It was from a couple of other apartments including mine."
EVC1vn1KQ2uETnTbDWXc5w,"Overall, a nice chill place that takes a contemporary and unique approach to Caribbean food. I think my only fault was that I went in there with a different expectation (my girlfriend and I went there for <occasion>dinner</occasion>), when it is definitely more of a loungey and drinks type of place, not so much of a full-fledged restaurant per-se.   Service 5/5 - Good service, the waiter serving us was very polite and helpful, asked us how our meal was and refilled our water frequently.   Food 3/5 - The food was good, but it was underwhelming at the same time. We ordered the <dish>Jerk Chicken</dish> and the <dish>Oxtail Croquette</dish>. Although I understand that we ordered from the \Snacks\"" section, I still expected a bit more, especially for what I was paying (and I guess my experiences with other Caribbean joints). I believe that the <dish>Jerk Chicken</dish> was only a drumstick and a thigh + some slaw (someone please correct me if I am wrong, I am writing this review post-dated), and then the <dish>Oxtail Croquettes</dish> were kind of small and there was barely any meat inside them. The food was not even hot (it was warm), and we ended up going somewhere else after <restaurant>Cadillac Jenkins</restaurant> to sate our hunger.  Price 2.5/5 - Hard to justify what we paid for, especially due to the fact that there were so many other restaurants nearby that would have provided better food and/or a lower price."""

GcVsgbyPtrTZEcssYS9cVQ,"Been here a few times since it opened....first time white rice undercooked, second time, no steamed rice...tonight no string bean chicken. Most of the entrees were almost out with no offer to make new batches. Now, 8 out of 10 times the employee would ask if we wanted them to make more but not here...when they're out, they're out and you're out of luck, and what you do get is skimpier portions compared to other location. No, it wasn't close to closing time, nor was it insanely busy. I get the feeling the manager is trying to keep his food budget as low a possible to make a bigger bonus for himself. 3 times asking and no crispy noodles, they don't have any...not \sorry we are out or they're on order\"". We are definitely going to the nearby location on Eastern next time. Hopefully the manager has it together.""",1

rNiZY9ZuzZWkMgao_Ab9Tw,It's disgraceful.  The grounds are poorly kept.  I've complained numerous times about how they have removed items at my grandmother's graveside. Now the headstones on her row have been moved and put back crooked. They give all kinds of excuses. I go frequently to clean up and care for my grandmother's grave and those around her. It breaks my heart to see how they have disregarded or concerns and complaints and taken no accountability or even fix the issues.
AqqJ3ZenY5EJ-3GEhngkqQ,I had a really good experience with Good Drivers. Growing up in Mississauga when it was time to get my drivers license my cousin referred me to this family owned business.

I was super excited as I thought they would have plenty of healthy options including lots of vegan options.  Sadly, they only have one or two vegetarian options for breakfast and lunch/dinner.  I came on the first day (and I'll excuse hiccups because they were obviously trying to work through the kinks) and got a <dish>vegetable burrito</dish> which was okay.  Nowadays, when I order a burrito, they either put in brown rice or give you a choice of brown or white rice.  This place only had white rice. So I stuck with it, but I seriously don't understand how a place called Fit for Life can only have white rice and no other grain options.   At 8.99, the burrito was not cheap, it was somewhat filling, but not necessarily satisfying. I felt it was missing something. They had guacamole, but I didn't really taste it.  Verdict: It's normal fast food 'healthy' but nothing spectacular.  I'd rather go to Salad Days.",1
OTSQq4ycH4NNhWIHcjnGaw,Review is for the Dress for Success dry cleaner.   Dropped off two suits and a dress on a Friday. Was told they would be ready Sunday. Werent ready until Wednesday. Was then told it was because memorial day caused a delay. Shouldn't have mattered as they were supposed to be done beforehand and even then they should have been done Tuesday at the minimum.   Caused a problem because even some basic stains weren't touched and didn't have time to take them elsewhere before going to a wedding.   Six days and it cost 33 dollars. Would have been 26 at thirty cleaners in Oakland to be done the same day.   Just terrible. Just go elsewhere. Not even remotely convenient.

I've had a lot of different types of chile relleno, most being stuffed with goodness, but this one was flat wrapped in some egg type bread batter nastiness, and topped with cheese.  I don't know what it was, but it had a type of omelette texture and was kind of rubbery/chewy.  Can't explain, it was  gross!  <dish>Fish taco</dish> was very bland, lacking any flavor.  It was a few pieces of fried soggy fish, with lettuce, cheese and a spoon full of mayo.  Pass, pass, pass!!  BF had a <dish>burrito</dish>, and it was huge!!

I walked in, wasn't greeted, so I walked up to the counter, grabbed menus and sat down.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to order and sit down, or if it was table service?  I noticed other people sitting with the menu, so I just took a seat.  She took forever to take our order.  We got up to ask for the check, ask for to-go containers, and we also walked back up to pay?? Not a big deal, but the woman running the front of the house wasn't very hospitable.",1
05v_QOp0jTxmP03diMR76g,"Location: Their location changes frequently so best to look them up before you head over there. Right now, they're at 250 Ste. Catherine East. Street parking is available but metered, and the closest subway is St. Laurent or Berri.   The place: Fresh Paint was founded back in 2011 by the gang who organizes Under Pressure. As I mentioned above, their location changes frequently and that's because they want to make good use of empty spaces by converting them into cultural spaces. Kinda like pop-up shops.   The goods: Because they're pretty involved with the street art and graff scene, you will find a regular rotation of exhibits that feature local artists - whether they be well-known, or emerging. They often have 'themes' which is cool because you get various artists' creative perspectives on stuff like skateboards, for example. Typically the spaces are not huge, so it can get a little cramped sometimes, if you're stopping by for an event. These guys also regularly hold the Fresh Paint market where you can pick up some cool stuff by local artists.   Service: N/A  Price point: All they ask is that you donate $2!  Definitely worth checking out if you like art, and particularly if like me, you're into the street art/graffiti scene."

xtN3UOz1xFu3usxWeXTvhQ,"I will be so thankful whenever this plaza is done.. because right now, its confusing as ever especially if you are coming from McIntyre Square. .   I'm also confused if The Block Northway is considered the building that houses Nordstrom Rack, Saks & Marshalls........ or the entire plaza that also include Container Store, Pet Smart ect.   Regarding the actual building, only 3 stores can be accessed in it. Dont get me wrong, I'm excited to have these stores in the city, but I guess I just expected the structure of it to be different. They should get better lighting and signs to know what is where.. because not everything can be accessed from both sides. For instance, If you are at the container store and want to head to marshalls, you have to walk down a few storefronts, go into the building, up the escalator and you're there.   There is a lot of empty (parking) space here so I'm sure they'll fill it in with big box stores. yas (sarcasm?... maybe). I'll update once more stores head in here. For now, im just glad that I learned how to navigate it. It was awkward asking someone at Saks how to get to the container store lol."

The <dish>wings</dish> actually included wings and not just drum sticks which was different but welcome. The combination of dry and wet wings was amazing. All flavours were on point. The tandoori was a real dry tandoori. The hot honeys went well every few wings as a good sauce wing. The dills were aromatic and you were inhaling their dry seasoning before they hit the table.

Xk0WyApIlEIjoTkDR5PBzQ,"They charged me $512 for a single visit with 2 rabbits WITHOUT ANY HEADS-UP - and they most definitely did NOT provide $512 worth of services. I was sick to my stomach when I left. VCA Fox Chapel is a rip off and they provide a disservice to animals and pet owners.   After seeing the breakdown of the bill, I could't believe how much they charged. The one rabbit is (per statement vet) not going to get better. Yet, he still drew blood and several yelled codes to the techs. He also drew blood from the other bunny and yelled similar codes to the back. Turns out each of these \codes\"" he yelled back was a blood test for which they charged about $60 a piece. The one bunny also got 2 injections: 0.3 ml of PenG was $41.72 (mind the fact that I have this bottle of PenG at home because the vet put the other bunny on this medication weeks ago, so he should/ could have remembered that and just let me give the injection at home if that's what they charge for this! And the whole 100 ml bottle was about $8 at the store) and 0.1 ml (yes, a tiny tiny amount) of Metacam for $43.34. The base consultation is $77 for a bunny.   The office manager later told me that I should have just asked about costs during the visit (and kindly offered to put a note on my file that I am a customer who would like to be informed about costs (of course, there will be no next time)). When I explained that I feel that the vet has a responsibility to keep a pet owner posted when he is about to rack up a hefty bill with a bunch of tests, she said that the vet just wanted to be thorough. I think that the vet or the vet tech knew exactly what kind of charges they were incurring and I am so mad and disappointed that they abused the situation.  When the check-out lady saw how flabbergasted I was, she asked if I told the vet I had money trouble. Money trouble? Because I'm not prepared to pay $512 for a single visit? All I can do at this point is warn other people not to go to the Fox Chapel VCA..."""

cDLiwirmGrptqiIYUdkxiQ,"Love love these guys! Went there after getting quotes from Lowes & Home Depot. Quotes from those places were between $4100-$4400. Budget Flooring had WAY more carpet choices, the staff was amazing, and their quote was half of the big chain stores. They just finished and it looks amazing! They did my stairs, landing, 2 hallways, master & 1 guest room for HALF the price folks, half! I'm glad I gave my hard earned money to this local business and I'll use them again next time I need flooring. I read some of their bad reviews, my guess is the problem was the customer, not the business because I have nothing to complain about."

GPs6TrZfNZMJlYd2EIM04A,"After researching several professional window cleaning services, some with extremely high prices, I contacted CCC at the recommendation of my housekeeping service.  I was able to effortlessly receive an estimate and schedule the service.  On the day of the service the crew called to ask if they would come earlier than promised which was nice.  They quickly went to work cleaning interior and exterior as well as removing and treating my solar screens.  The windows are, well, crystal clear and sparkle!   The screens look new after the conditioner was applied.  All this for a very, very reasonable price!  I will be hiring CCC again at least after every monsoon season, if not more often!  Thanks guys for a job very well done!  I will never again attempt to clean with Outdoor Windex - what a mess I made!"
4uqX-_OY-bU1FY87W-gSRg,"I found Gustavo on Yelp after calling several other realtors. All other realtors I previously called were resolved to tell me how difficult it was to find an investment property in my price range. When I called Gustavo I was prepared to hear more of the same. However, Gustavo was completely positive and was certain he could help us find what we were looking for. He was completely involved through the whole process. He didn't just send my wife and I listings and tell us to go check them out. He made time to be physically present at every showing. He was always available to take our calls or texts and kept us constantly updated. When we finally found the property we were to buy,   Gustavo was involved all the way through the escrow process. He even fought to get us money back from the seller for some issues with the home. He was even present at signing to ensure that all the documentation was correct. I highly recommend Gustavo for anyone looking a primary reason or an investment property because he shows that he cares and that he wants you to succeed. We are so blessed to have found him and completely expect to work with him again in the future!"

iVV6E4YFm_Y7bMudao_xXA,"This Fry's has some exceptional people working here.  And now, for the rest of the story...  Wherever possible, Fry's Gas Stations have been sprouting up throughout the Valley.  This one opened about six months ago.  After having dinner last night at Red House (excellent as usual, btw), I noticed I was near empty.  As I came in I also realized it was the third of the month.  Since we hadn't gone shopping yet that means we didn't have any points.  No matter I thought, we needed gas.    The attendant, Joe T was outside helping folks. When was the last time your saw a gas station attendant outside helping people?  Joe does a lot of that I found out.  One woman who had a rental VW, couldn't figure out how to open her tank.  She asked for my assistance, but Joe had fixed it by the time I walked over. I on the other hand was had problems getting the pump to accept my card.  Seems, it doesn't matter if you do not have any points.  Unless you input your Fry's card, the machine doesn't work. D'oh!  Well. Joe came by and fixed it. So we got to chatting.  He believes the more time he's spends behind the glass; the less time he can be outside helping customers!  He told me he likes being able to help folks.  Feels that's the real job, his job.  Wow!  So Four Stars to Joe T for understanding the service end of the pump, and Fry's for hiring him.  Nice!"
6G2KEkAgkAgSpIb4U8DgNw,"I would just like to say that Dr.lee is awesome! he was always very nice and caring to me as his patient.The reason for my bad review was not on behalf of Dr.lee himself but more about the staff he has working for him!! I had a follow up with Dr.Lee thinking it was scheduled for 8:30am when according to his front desk girl/\manager\"" was at 8:00am. so, here I am signed in telling her I had an appointment with Dr. lee and her response to me as unprofessional as she is was...\""wow, oh wow!\"" your appointment was at 8:00am\"" by the way, I was the only one signed in at this point his first appointment of day. I also work in the medical field and would that have been me my response to my Dr.'s patient would definitely  not be \""wow, oh wow!\"" but more like. Okay, looks like your appointment was scheduled for 8:00am but let me just check with the Dr rather then just take it upon my self to make his decision if he wants to still see the patient or not.  Now, this was not my first visit, it was just a follow up which in the past had only taken about 15 minutes or so not to much of Dr time at all. well i was not seen that day or offered to schedule another appointment all I got was a \""wow, oh wow!\"" several times. So, I scratched out my my name on the sign in sheet and walked out. Come to find out I receive a bill for $50 dollars!!!  To my surprise for a missed appointment. Really?? I showed up for this appointment and was not seen and yet according to his \""manager\"" I missed my appointment! so, I call the office to speak with billing and who do I get on the phone the same unprofessional and rude front desk girl. first, She never even asked me for my name or account number. All I said was that I had received a bill for a missed appointment, they may have caller i.d or something because she knew exactly who I was she then proceeded to tell me with her childish attitude that yes, I had missed the appointment because I was late! We then had several more exchange of words and asked her if Dr. Lee was aware of the way she speaks to his patient's, and asked to speak with manager?  That is when she informed me she was also the manager. So, I wanted to speak with Dr about my situation and also to inform him of what was going on and how his practice was being run. I was told that I could not see Dr.Lee unless my bill was paid for the appointment that I showed for but she considered missed.   At this point I was already fuming as I'm sure anyone would be  to top things off at the end of our conversation. I was told that I would also be dismissed from his practice.  I will NEVER be returning to this practice nor would I EVER recommend any family member or friends!!! Not because of Dr.Lee himself, he is a very nice and sweet Dr and seems to care about his patient's. Bu,t more so because of his very rude staff.  **DO NOT GO unless you want to be dealing with very ill mannered STAFF!!!**"""

Still, you're pretty much guaranteed to find something you never knew you needed. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the prices are reasonable."
ROyteoFTxe7i3PZCE3ivvg,"Full disclosure: I would rather have a root canal then get my car serviced. Finding an honest, reliable mechanic is like finding a needle in a haystack. And because I'm not the most mechanically-inclined person, I'm always worried about being taken to the cleaners by less-than-scrupulous mechanics. So when you find that mechanic, you hold on to them as if your car's life depended on it. Because it does. We started coming here for routine oil changes based on the Yelp reviews. This week our Jeep started making a horrible noise, we immediately called Mikes and told us to immediately come over. Even though they were very busy, the guys immediately looked at our car, diagnosed the problems within minutes, ordered the parts from across town, and even offered to rush the service while my wife waited. They didn't try to \upsell\"" or find problems that didn't exist. Their prices were fair. Hopefully we won't need their services often, but if we do, we know we can trust Mike's."""

After selecting, we were told to come back in 20 minutes to pick up our pictures.   50 minutes later, and still no pictures. First I was told they were behind. I don't know since my pictures should print out 1st. After I asked since I had already paid and now my grandson is hungry and getting cranky, could they accommodate me for my inconvience.

Beverages are self-serve so there's no need for a server to ask what you want to drink.

Anyway, <occasion>breakfast</occasion> was pretty standard as far as selection and taste goes, although I didn't see any French Toast, my fav.  It may have been too late since it was about 10:30am we arrived, but still.   I did indulge in one of those mini-boxes of Fruit Loops.  A guilty pleasure for sure.

I can speak over my last few experiences at this location and if you have someone that you find (for me, the service I've had from Craig (RMT) and Christina (facial) have been out of the park every time), but the other half of the time has been disappointing.   While I love the owners/business itself here, just in terms of massage quality, this is not a place I would recommend walk in's because it's too much of a gamble in terms of the quality of the RMT you get - some are very good but some are just very very poor.  My last experience was so poor I just have to put in a PSA (and luckily I have had so many massages in the past, I now have conviction to speak up when an RMT is just poor vs just being style preference). I spoke up several times during the massage to stop this person from injuring me (e.g. raising both my legs at an awkward position at both my knees and then leaning hard on them, resting their entire weight on my elbow joint for leverage as they used one other arm to massage my arm). The entire massage was so poor that I stopped the massage in the middle, paid the full price and left. I'm not concerned about the money but my time (someone had to watch my kids for me while I \treated\"" myself to a massage), the risk of injury and the disappointment putting a damper on the rest of my day is just not worth it.

That being said, <restaurant>Mami's</restaurant> was a bit disappointing in my eyes. <restaurant>Mami's</restaurant> is a small little food stand located in the food court of the Oriental Centre at Brimley and Shepphard. The place itself doubles as a tiny little grocery selling some filipino items to go along with the menu. The menu itself offers plates like Adobo Chicken, pork knuckles, and meat skewers.  I ordered the <dish>Adobo Chicken</dish> and <dish>pork skewers</dish>. It comes with a side of <dish>rice</dish> and a drink for around $5, which is great. The <dish>adobo chicken</dish> was served in a cup which was a mistake. There is a lot of grease and fat that came with their <dish>adobo chicken</dish>, so much of it compiles at the bottom. The taste was fine, but the oily meat was disappointing.   The skewer, on the other hand, was very flavorful and cooked wonderfully. I wish I got more than one. The meat was tender and the slightly charred exterior was awesome. Definitely better than the <dish>adobo chicken</dish>.  Prices are great, but the food was a bit lackluster.

I read the Yelp reviews about it not being your traditional Catholic church so I wanted to give it a try.  It isn't your typical catholic church.  But it was enjoyable.  My family was able to follow the prayers and songs via the projector.  We enjoyed the homily and the guest speaker, a young boy.  For me, it was a different kind of experience, a very good spiritual experience.  During the communion, the projector mentioned it is given in 2 pieces, the body and blood of Christ and would be given to your mouth.   I was a bit nervous for my son who has only been receiving communion for 1 year now, by hand.  Luckily we weren't in the front and I was able to teach him how to receive the bread by his mouth.  We were pleased with receiving the body and blood of Christ and talked about our experience after mass.  The bread, is dipped in the wine before it is given; there is no cup to drink out of.  When we returned home the following week to attend mass at our local church, my son mentioned how he missed St. Sharbel and how they give communion.  :)"

So after an hour wait inside Labcorp, my name got called only to find out that they don't have any order faxed, so i called their clinic and I was met with ' I sent it to quest because that's what i heard' in a very rude voice. I said that i never asked for it to be sent to quest and she proceed to tell me that 'i know what i heard' and said goodbye. I went back inside Labcorp and told the front that they are sending the order now but all they get is an 'error' so i called again but this time, i get directed to a beeping sound like if you dialed a fax number through your phone. So, frustrated, i called about 8 times before i got thru and again, no sorry or not even try to accomodate me that day(they draw blood in their clinic too), reason being, i have to have an appointment.

Having access to a full service Starbucks, complete with seating is an Oasis!   It allows people to come get some comfort food or just a quick caffeine fix and relax for a few minutes.  The seating area is nice and off set from the hospital (helps you forget that you are in a hospital).    Staff was very friendly and helpful.  This Starbucks provided me a nice break. .or distraction . .from a very bad day.    Great idea Starbucks and UMPC!"
wCZyJMCNs4UNlfixpb8RrA,"Really delicious but really expensive. A <dish>small sandwich</dish> and a <dish>flat white with vanilla syrup</dish> came to $17. Kind of steep but the <dish>flat white with vanilla syrup</dish> was delicious. You can see specs of vanilla in it. They also sell the syrup in a cute glass bottle and it looks beautiful.   Service was for the most part friendly. They mistook half my order as to-stay instead of to-go and one woman wanted to dump my flat white into a to-go cup. Umm yeah for $5, make it again, as it was your colleague's mistake not mine. I need to Instagram that stuff and I can't Instagram a sloppy latte. Her colleague was going to make it again but she wanted to save on the ingredients and told him to just dump it in a paper cup. I thought that was kinda cheap; you're charging customers $5 for a coffee, it should be perfect. She did make it again and it was beautiful and tasted divine, and was indeed perfect.   Beautiful old fashioned fancy decor. Same idea as the original Dineen but a slightly different style. Super adorable. Loved the decor. I liked the leather, pink (pretend) marble tables, even though they were plastic.   The $10 sandwich was kind of mediocre, but the $5 flat white with vanilla syrup was amazing.   Crowded on weekends. Standing room near the cash is cramped but the bar seating along the wall behind it that makes it feel cramped adds extra seating.  They might get a patio in the summer they said. It would be a super cute place for a summer coffee date.   Room for improvement: don't cheap out--if you make a mistake, fix it, don't compromise on the quality of the product you deliver to save a buck. You're a bougie coffee shop, and people who spend $20 for a coffee and a small sandwich expect a 5-star experience.   They serve alcohol at night until 10pm.   I would totally come back.",1
CfeI-Qy1KzQV4vAdvLNY7g,"I had a lovely time here with my pup today. I was pleasantly surprised by how sterile and well monitored this place was. I much prefer the smell of bleach to smells I've experienced at other dog bars in Charlotte. It's an excellent set up with lots of space. Great beer list and I love the tall tables outside. Will definitely be back for another play date, the dogs all seem to be in a good mood because they're basically in doggie heaven. It seems the owners/managers/staff have a well thought out concept and execution, great addition to the area."

My husband brought a few cola sours, mix of chocolates, licorices (def not for me), sour worms, gummi bears.... I say we did pretty good for $20, we got ourselves some sweet treats for our drive in town.   There were also some collectibles and vintage lunch boxes that are out of print. It's a pretty rare find in this town. I would def love to come back again!"
eX5hOHPfpaOuI6ikvv_UZw,"Coffee pretentious it should be called! It's laughable today because I had time to soak in the absurdity and price tag that came with my visit to coffee proper. It was after 7 pm on a Friday and the men working with their wild awesome beards gave me a hello as I walk in and I thought okay this place looks cool, I've been wanting to stop in for awhile now and they carry my paleo friendly \treats\""that I thought this place is going to be my new Mecca. I was wrong, so so wrong. This very NYC mixed with Seattle'esque barista was cute and looked so promising and his glorious beard made me think that this dude knows what the f he is doing....  As the hipsterish/emo/cavemenesque barista with blank stare asks me what I would like I order a double espresso for my husband who was in the car waiting as I stopped in. I wanted to like him because that beard was well awesome. I wanted to order a coffee with coconut milk or heavy cream as I am paleo and can't have dairy.  He proceeds to weirdly state that HE (the barista god) has made the exception of just carrying whole, grass fed, cow milk and that they too are a Paleo place and understood why I was asking and again as I'm telling him I don't do dairy-I ask so no pure coconut milk? He again says 3 haunting words \""grass fed milk\"". You are paleo friendly yet only carry dairy? This made no sense to me. What about the individuals who are vegan or lactose intolerant? Do you force them to drink grass fed cow milk latte's because you don't want to carry another option and made an exception to only this glorious grass fed milk? I was annoyed, that beard was looking less godly by the millisecond.  What about Kalhona grass fed cow organic pure heavy cream? One of the best creams on the market that I love so dearly? I see you carry epic bars, Jackson honest chips (which they marked up $2 a bag from retail btw) and primal chocolate bars but no other \""milk option\"". I started regretting ordering that espresso...   The espresso. He proceeds to ask me which bean I would like, I said this is for hubby in the car who is staying with our daughter, so whatever he feels is the best espresso (I don't drink espresso's) and that my husband knows,  breathes and lives his espresso's. He tells me again he will \""make an exception\"" and serve it in a to go cup because he would rather not do that and I said okay thanks? What if I was running to a meeting or a yoga class and I wanted my espresso to go? Will you force me to order it for there and stand over me as you watch me drink it while your beard cascades in front of my face? I am a $30 paying customer and if i want it to go damnit you better give it to me to go...So freakin weird...he is starting to creep me out, and obviously the to go espresso messes up his barista powers and gasp might ruin the espresso (which sucked btw) I tell him the hubby travels the world literally for work and he has tasted the finest espresso's from Italy to Singapore to Vietnam etc..so whatever he feels is best make him that-you my friend are the expert correct? I am hopeful. I stock up on my way overpriced marked up goodies I kinda needed and $30 later I'm out the door with the espresso and shamed that I literally spent that much on 2 bags of chips, 2 epic bars primal chocolate and that damn espresso.. The moment of truth, hubby gets the espresso and as I am there so proud that he is going to taste the best espresso ever (ummm beard made it) tastes it and literally not kidding spoiled up his face spit it out in the cup and was like WTF is this! He was so pissed he was about to go inside and freak out on my bearded barista. I talked him out of it. Like I said before you can't pull the \""oh this is a bean from wherever and it's slowly roasted at this temp to give it this luxurious crema and taste on the palate\"" BS. He knows his espresso-trust me and his well travelled palate. I tasted it and almost gagged myself it was like drinking a straight shot of vinegar and I thought maybe this espresso bean is supposed to taste like? Nope. It was so incredibly bitter and acidic and not in a good way at all hubby says in all his time he has NEVER tasted one so unpalatable. The entire car ride home he was livid about me paying that much for crap, tossed it out the window and called the place to speak with the barista-luckily no answer.   My husband the calm loving real espresso drinker was about to call the bearded dragon and freak out on him for ruining his precious palate.  Laughing, I told him about my experience in the shop and we laughed so much at how we have travelled to the greatest barista coffee shops in the world and in the US and this was the most pretentious shop with the most pretentious barista who \""obviously\""knows his espresso which sucked.  Oh and btw fantastic bearded gent we will not be stopping back to try your African/Ethiopian blended espresso you wanted me to recommend to hubby he will get a real one when he visits that country""",1

84wisPoQCMx8jIY5hF5ALw,"I had the worst experience of my life using Hertz. I will not only never EVER use them again but when all my friends and family heard what happened to me, they won't use you either in fear of what happened.  I select \to be picked up\"" on the website. It asks me to give the address of where I would like to be picked up and the time. I give them the address on my hotel on the las vegas strip and the time. As I am waiting on the day of pick up I figure I would call them to find out why they weren't there yet. I get a lifeless voice saying they don't pick up from the airport of the las vegas strip. SO good to know, like 3 weeks ago when they asked online. No phone call, nothing.   I arrive, i paid for upgraded midsize as I have a car seat and lots of luggage for 10 day use. When I arrive they customer service agent says she will pull my car around. She brings a ford fiesta (economy) and the smallest, old model car. I tell her that is not the car I paid for. I didn't just reserve it, I paid a few weeks in advance already. She tells me that it's the only car besides a pick up truck they will have all day. I have no choice. I am dumbfouded. Her reaction was irritated that I even asked. They had no solution. I told her I wasn't paying the upgraded price to use this car. she told me she would throw in a half tank of gas. WHAT??? I paid $60 extra for an upgraded car and she gives me gas? I have no choice at this point, she told me nothing else was coming in all day. I'm in Las Vegas, not the middle of nowhere. So in I go trying to fit all my things which was piled on top of each other. I couldn't see out of my rear view mirror because of how small this car was and how much stuff I had. I drive to utah and notice my cell phone wasn't charging on the car plug in. I was using it for GPS. My phone dying and now I was in the middle of the dessert with no directions. awesome. I had to call my sister and get written directions because my phone was about to die- which it did soon after.  I had to drive from utah back to CA and I wasn't about to use this crappy car the whole way without a navigation. So I stopped off at St George and had to wait in line and spend an extra 2 hours switching my car back to the original car I should have had in the first place.  fast forward to drop off, I'm in laughlin and called the airport hertz to see if I can just bring the car there instead of driving the extra 30 mins to the other location since I was going to the airport anyway. I was onto phone for 40 minutes with them. I kept getting people from the Philipeans who kept telling me it wasn't possible and that they could transfer me. around and around I went to different people and everyone said they couldn't help me and to bring it to my specified location. So.... I go back to the location I picked up from and when I pull up I see a girl employee walk out of the rental door. She walks past me struggling with my 4 year old and 4 luggages at 7 months pregnant. I continue up the ramp to find the door locked. I'm in a hurry because I have a flight to catch and I assume there is a \""drop your car Here\"" location, which there wasn't. So I walk around to see people in the \""Hertz Sales dept\""  I walk past them to the rentals door and again, lights off and nobody in there. I stop and ask a guy with a hertz shirt on where I should drop my car. He tells me he doesn't know, he works for sales. I ask him where rentals drop off are. He tells me that they left. It closed a few minutes ago.  Mind you, it's noon on a Saturday.  I am again dumbfounded by the response and the attitude that comes with it. I'm just trying to drop this car and go all the way back to the airport by cab. But alas, I get nowhere with this guy. He just acts like it's a surprise that I'm standing there trying to give this car away. He tells me I have to find another location to drop it. end of story. I ask for the manager. He replies \""I am the manager\"".  You have got to be kidding me. What is happening? I am now very much in danger of missing my flight because I was suppose to be on my way to be dropped in front of the airport by cab and now I have to get directions to the other location and go through the process of drop off again. So, I load my stuff and child back into the car and spend 5 minutes finding navigation the \""airport\"" location. Which is not at the airport at all, but 20 minutes away by cab. So, in a rush I sped as fast as possible 20 more minutes away to the airport location. Dropped my luggage, looked at the shuttle line which was LONG and not a shuttle in sight. I grabbed a cab and headed to the airport which took another 20 minutes. When I got to the airport and unloaded my luggage and 4 year old, got to the counter and sure enough, I was too late to check in by 5 minutes.  Now, mind you I am waddling at 7 months pregnant, holding a 4 year old's hand and carrying 4 luggages. and our 2:00 pm flight has now just become a red eye at 1am the next morning. My life for the"""

x4cCFdLMKOudfIyxOMtUJA,"Finally, a good pizza place in NDG. It was long overdue. Seriously.  This great little spot was just opened up  by Paolo Oliveira (from Brasserie Central and formerly Café Mélies) and his partner Eric. The concept is pretty straightforward: a Montreal style pizzeria that also serves simple yet yummy salads and appetizers, wines and beer.  As far as <dish>pizza</dish> goes, their pie is super yummy. They don't have a wood-burning oven, but the <dish>pizza</dish> is definitely as good as any from one. They use simple, high-quality ingredients, and all the flavors are just as they should be.   The place itself has a modern but friendly vibe. The restaurant sits in a former furrier shop (one of those places that was there for decades and never changed) and the interior features some cute little reminders of the space's former life (re: cow hide seat backs and old signage out front).  This is by far the BEST pizza you will find anywhere west of St-Laurent. I'll be hitting this pizzeria on a weekly basis. Yeah!",1

M_lLpjNIiGiuwxB-lNtgFA,"Dreaming Summit Animal Hospital is the BEST vet I have ever had.  Let me tell you my story. I am a animal LOVER I have 4 dogs currently and they all visit Dr. Bower and Dr. Hillbrand.  Orlando is my 5 year old maltese/yorkie mix when he was 6 months old he got Parvo even though he had been vaccinated against it.  We took him to the emergency vet and were basically told that he needed to be put down.  I paid 1000 just for them to tell me that.  But it was a Sunday and I didn't have a choice.   On Monday I took him to Dreaming Summit (my first visit to them) we saw Dr. Bower and he confirmed the parvo diagnosis but did not agree with putting him down either.  The estimate I received for treatment was $1900 for 3 days medication and observation.  I didn't have it as I had just spent 1000 at the emergency vet I asked for alternatives desperate to save my pet.  He showed me how to administer subcutaneous fluids and gave me the fluids and all of the equipment I needed to do it , gave me an antibiotic and a list of over the counter meds to give to Orlando he said if he got worse to bring him righ back in or to call him.  For all of this he charged me $120.00.  Orlando went for a follow up visit 2 weeks later perfectly healthy.  Dr. Bower saved my pups life and he is a happy healthy dog now.  On to case #2 Samson, my 3 year old Pitbull.  Samson was diagnosed with Plano by another vet before we got him at 4 months old.  This causes lameness but we were assured he would grow out of it.  He was always limping and the paws changed we gave over the counter pain meds and waited for him to \grow\"" out of it.  Then one day he had a seizure and we rushed him to Dreaming Summit.  Turns out Samson had valley fever with NO lung involvement by this time it was in his bones and brain (seizure) and there was no way to cure him but Dr. Hillbrand and Dr. Bower took such great care of him and all for REASONABLE prices he is now pain free and while he will be on meds his whole life he is ALIVE.  I will never take my pets anywhere else.  These are the most caring vets I have ever met they know my dogs by name and love on them when we go every time.   I hope this review is helpful I normally don't right them but this vet warranted one."""
RiGtSzVzc42CKjyZkDxZRA,"This is by far the WORST venue there is. Ursula and her staff were so unaccomodating. She would promise you something and the next time you talk with her she would say she couldn't deliver or if she did it would be at a premium. We were promised so many things over and over again and they did not deliver. This venue ended up cancelling my wedding 5 weeks prior to my wedding date! I mean seriously who does that. Not to mention, the head chef and owner is so arrogant to the fact that he thinks his food is all that and did not even want to do a tasting. Also, they wanted me to rent my own dishes when they said they could accommodate up to 220 people. Ursula should not be doing this as a profession..she clearly can not handle weddings.

ME10QNtUeZMdC7EhSjHzGA,"Dear Potential Resident,  I hope that you read this before considering leasing or renting here as I think that some valuable insight from a current resident will help.    It would be folly to move into these apartments at this point, there are a plethora of incredible complexes mere moments away, and for all the 'charm' this place has it is face value only and quickly diminishes the second you move in.  Let me preface this by saying that this complex has extreme potential to be excellent if some key issues get taken care of (mostly an unresponsive management team that thinks they are still in high school), and I will modify my review accordingly if I can get the manager to get anything fixed.  I moved in several months ago, and upon moving in I have never been so surprised and appalled in my entire life.  The apartment clearly had not been cleaned since the prior residents; mold in the bathroom, urine all around (and in the toilet) floors peeling up (cheap laminate not hardwood that literally come up a bit more every time I clean them) black stains on the wall, and clearly someone had been smoking several packs a day inside the apartment.    This wasn't initially a huge issue as I figured that since it was filthy upon moving in and in a great state of disrepair I wouldn't be charged moving out (that remains to be seen).  Here are a small selection of issues I have had since moving in;  Burglary my first week here....easy to get in an out of (several neighbors (five?) have had break ins since we've been here....this is a transient type community and the proximity to Apache makes us a very easy target).....you would think they would ramp up the security but I have yet to see the supposed security guard they employ even one time in four months despite several requests for even a phone number to call......shady.  Lots of drugs and shady individuals live here but that's probably anywhere, we have excellent immediate neighbors (fortunately) and their seems to be a real mix....regardless I don't feel safe having my girlfriend or sister walking alone at night.  Waited over a month to have the ducts and vents cleaned (black soot would spew out anytime the air was on covering all of my earthly possessions in dust and grime) some of the smell has gone away but not really still smells disgusting at all times.  Mold and mildew run rampant in the bathroom I have to bleach the walls almost daily to fight it and if I don't they are yellow and black not to mention most of the laminate is peeling and roaches and ants occasionally escape from the cracks between the tub.  All in all I could probably keep going......the kitchen is nice, and I do like the styling of the community and surprisingly the common areas tend to stay fairly clean. but I really think you have a major break down in communication from resident to manager to management company and things (lots of them) are slipping through the cracks.  Until they re-staff I would continue looking elsewhere I have a friend at Cabana on Thomas and this is not the case with that community at all....."

Fair quality, gigantic portions, and fair prices.  The boyfriend and I found ourselves in Solon running errands for a friend, and decided to grab <occasion>dinner</occasion> there.  Maybe we were in the wrong part of town, but dinner options seem to be a bit limited in Solon.  We chose <restaurant>Pacific East</restaurant> because we love sushi and because we had a decent experience at the Cleveland location.  Upon first entering the establishment, we were turned off by the intense fishy smell.  It was seriously overpowering....I wanted to turn around and leave, but the boyfriend convinced me to stay.  The place was completely empty except for two other customers.  It appears that this location used to be a Wendy's or Roy Roger's, or some other fast-food joint.  It has those curved windows that you often see at said establishments.  The decor inside was pretty plain.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Our water glasses were kept full and our server repeatedly checked in to see if we needed anything.  I suppose this is a benefit of dining in an empty restaurant.  For our meal, we chose to split the \<dish>Bridge for Two</dish>\"" which contains 14 pieces of nigiri, 22 pieces of sashimi, a spicy tuna roll, and a California roll.  It is served with <dish>house salad</dish> and <dish>miso soup</dish> for two as well.  Total cost?  $50.  The <dish>miso soup</dish> was a tad on the salty side, but still flavorful.  The salad was the typical salad you get a sushi restaurants: iceburg, cucumber, tomato, and ginger dressing.  When our \""bridge\"" arrived, it was beautifully presented.  The sushi chef obviously took pride in the presentation.  The amount of fish on it was actually a bit daunting.  The chef did not skimp on the cuts of fish.  The fish on the nigiri was literally hanging off both ends of the rice.  The sashimi was cut into huge slices.  The rolls were completely stuffed with goodies.  I normally don't even like rolls, but I devoured these without a problem.  We were hardly able to finish the entire meal, but didn't want to waste good food, so we made ourselves uncomfortably full.  It was worth it.  The quality of the fish was good, but not great.  While we had much variety, some of the fish seemed a bit dull.  None of it tasted bad by any means, just not as fresh and flavorful as it could have been.  I was quite pleased that the fish was served at the perfect temperature, too.  Would I go out of my way to grab sushi here?  No, probably not.  But it's good, especially for the area.""",1

However, in the early 2000's, it was not a hang out for college kids.

rq9CwVtuJDhML2MTN268JA,"Ebikes are a blast; However, there are a few technical considerations. If you have a shop with knowledgeable and helpful people, you are in a much better situation. Lenny and his staff are EXTREMELY knowledgeable and also very active in the ebike community. As a matter of fact, Lenny and several other members of the shop take part regularly in the ebike forum, sharing their knowledge. The ebike forums are where others recommended Lenny's shop to me - and who best to listen to, than the ebike veteran owners?! This is a big part of what convinced me to go with Lenny's - their great reputation amongst the community.  I first purchased the eflow Nitro for fun, and then a month later I purchased the Stromer ST1 for commute purposes. Lenny's shop offered me MUCH better prices than other shops, which helped me to get in the game. Ebikes are definitely worth their price, but the amounts can be daunting to someone who is completely new to ebikes. Thanks to Lenny's, I was able to get started much more easily, both in terms of finances and also in terms of dealing with the technical side of the bikes."

The service was quite poor.. no menus when we sat down and the waiters didn't seem to want to be there. The only decent dish there as the spicy beef noodle soup. The yang zhou fried rice was awful. It tasted like they just mixed white rice with a can of mixed vegetables, some ham, and forgot to add the salt. The rest of the dishes were kind of bad but not bad enough to talk about here."

We have asked questions about battery back-up and adding more panels and never get a response back.  This is unfortunate because they would have gotten 5 stars from us.

Also, the toppings themselves are pretty good quality, e.g. the olives actually taste like olives, rather than vaguely salty rubber faucet washers like at some pizza joints.I have no reservations recommending this place.

ZLuWpmvO41w2bSwufgfUlQ,"We were a little disappointed with our visit to <restaurant>Cielo</restaurant>, a restaurant inside the Hotel Theodore (used to be The Mondrian). The atmosphere is very modern and open, and the hostess was great. Our server was nice, but not incredibly helpful or enthusiastic. I had a few questions about the wine list, but he told us he didn't know much about wine. When the bartender didn't know much either, he mentioned that the manager could help. When he came back, he said the manager didn't want to come out, but agreed that a meritage I asked about was great. It was a great wine, but I was surprised the manager wouldn't take the time to come help in person. We started out with the Tuna tartare -- it was fine, but the portions were extremely small. The appetizer might have been appropriate for one person, but barely (the two of us had two bites each). Both of us ordered <dish>Creekstone Beef Tenderloin with prosciutto</dish> and <dish>white truffle mac & cheese</dish> -- fantastic. The only issue was that, again, the portions were small. We were both still hungry, so we ordered the <dish>Grilled Romaine</dish> which was fantastic.

It was good, but very, very small. When they put it down, we looked at each other and actually started laughing. It was a fun moment for us.

b3vx52OvKCUyxj7HuXYVGQ,"My husband and I have serviced our car several times at the Hyundai bowser service center. We were extremely disappointed by our last visit. We were given a rental car through enterprise as our car was under warranty. We were told to drop the rental off at bowser to pick up our car when it was ready. We did just that. We were told all customers drop off there rentals at bowser. The car was left in their open parking lot for 3 days. Enterprise was not even informed that the car was returned. On Tuesday we get a call from enterprise saying there is a huge crack on the windshield. We literally only used the car to get back home and then to pick up our car after it was ready, and it was in excellent condition without a scratch when returned. Clearly, the car was damaged as it was left to sit on an open lot at bowser. We were told that bowser holds no responsibility and will not get involved. We were very happy with the service Dan provided us. When it comes to bigger issues such as issues of liability, the upper management (Bill and Mike Salja) are very quick to absolve themselves and wash themselves of any wrongdoing. Unlike other dealerships that try to work out other arrangements or look for solutions, they wanted to avoid any help all together. That being said, we will not be using the services of bowser anymore, as we cannot trust this management. Although this dealership will probably provide services required, our most recent experience with them has left a bitter taste in our mouth. We do not believe the upper management is  trustworthy when it comes to important matters, thus we would not recommend this dealership. Be ware customers, do not return your rentals to bowser, return them directly to Enterprise (they will not tell you this). We were just about to upgrade our car to a family car after the arrival of our child. We will definitely not be going to bowser anymore. For the small price of a windshield, bowser has lost a family of once dedicated customers."

Our baseboards are higher than most and Charlie (the owner) and his crew came back to put extra padding below the carpet so there wouldn't be a gap between the baseboard and carpet.   Lastly, during our move in, the movers got some dirt on the carpet (bound to happen) - I called Gina and she ordered me wool only carpet cleaner.   They are a great, honest staff to deal with.

MNqGE0t4hOHMl2ap1LjoKA,"This place has horrible customer service and scheduling.  I was told by the physician    that I needed an MRI of my Neck.  \Okay\"", I said.  \""please go ahead and schedule me as soon as possible.  They told me that they first had to get pre-approval from my insurance company and that typically can take five days.  I say \""okay\"" and even provide them with the place that I would like to use for the MRI.   Six days goes by and no  response from Western Reserve and Pain institute.  So I call them ask if they have gotten approval.  They say that they have not even started the approval process. They say that they needed to know where I wanted to have it done which I already told them.  They denied that I told them where I wanted to go.  Basically called me a liar.  Said they a left voice mail on my cell and office phone.  My office phone is a land line and I assure you that if they would have left a message it would have been there.  So they called me a liar again saying that I got the voice mail.  I don't know much about customer service but I don't think calling the customer a liar is not good practice.  I finally get the MRI and I am diagnosed with herniated cervical disks.  They recommend that I get an Epidural Steroid injection in the cervical area C5, C6, C7.  Okay, I make the appointment for the procedure.  They give me a time and date for the appointment which I record on paper and even confirm back by repeating it.  They send out a letter which I did not receive until the day before the procedure.  The letter has multiple pages with instructions and buried within they had changed the procedure time.  I did not see the procedure time change until the day of the procedure.My wife had scheduled off time from her job so that she could drive me to and from the procedure which is required.  Now with the appointment time change she was going to have a problem with her job.  We went into the office 20 minutes prior to the original appointment as required for the procedure.   we Asked them was there anything that could be done to accommodate us.  They told me that I was not told the appointment time that I recorded on paper and called me a liar again.  At this point I was still early for the new appointment time which was later than the original time.  After being getting called a liar repeatedly and telling me that the time was the time and I would have to deal with it,  the office lady told me because I was confrontational with her that she had called the doctor and they had now cancelled my procedure.  So I took off work and drove to this facility to be called a liar and then because I didn't get on my knees and beg for forgiveness my procedure was cancelled.  The office lady there actually has the power to cancel your procedure if she doesn't like how you talk to her.  AMAZING.  I will never do business with this facility again.  I also found out that they are not affiliated with University Hospitals or Cleveland Clinic.  I am beginning to think they are a small shoddy operation.  If you value your time and health I would steer clear of this place."""

Oui, tout était frais, mais la fraîcheur sans saveur ça ne vaut pas la peine.

The first time we came in they told my daughter to just get rest and to buy some over the counter meds!! So I pay a copay and bring her to the doctor to go buy crap I can get over the counter! Second time I come back for her check up again another copay, can hear her still coughing like crazy, and guess what doctor tells me this is normal!! If she is still coughing after 2 weeks bring her back again, so her expert opinion I had to pay two copays for some over the counter meds and let it run its course!! Now I'm back for my third visit for my sons wellness and I come an hour early one person in the waiting room and I'm told your appointment is at 3 not 2, I am told I can either wait till three or come back I will not get seen early! I leave come back and then told I owe my copay I said I think there is a credit on my account, just to find out that they have been charging me for specialist visits instead of regular office visits!! Which now means all these times we come in our visits are twice as much, then when I ask her to check how long this has been going on, she rolls her eyes and says I doubt it happened more than once!! I'm thinking if it was your money I'm sure you would give a shit, so she then says they are checking for you but you still have to pay your copay today to be seen at regular cost, when it was already shown they overcharged me!!

There is only one individual at the office and the service guys who are professionally skilled. Otherwise, this place has management problems. If you're looking for all these problems combined into one location, then you truly will love living here at Falling Water Apartments. Also see http://www.apartmentratings.com/nv/las-vegas/falling-water-apartments_702363959889144/ and you will learn that Falling Water Apartments has many consistent problems reported.

fA7EapUU2Yve9bEtMvvAFA,"Came to Toronto for the first time for a wedding and am so happy to have found the perfect hotel! Initially, I was nervous the experience was not going to be positive - the hotel is located outside of the main city and currently sits next to a major construction zone. However, I am pleased to say that my first impression was completely off base! The hotel is very clean, bright, and modern, offering amenities which I've never seen in any hotel (in-room kitchenette, free coffee/cappuccino/espresso machine 24/7, complimentary breakfast and dinner, full gym, pool, printing station, just to name a few!). The room was beautiful and clean and felt more like a studio apartment than a hotel room. Close to major highways, the hotel is a short drive (20-30 min) from most tourist hotspots, making it an ideally accessible oasis in Toronto!"

pk7yFuGBcU2YFSw_gny7lA,"today was my first and last visit.  we have a mortgage loan through b of a and i have made the payment myself at 2 other locations no problem whatsoever.  some lady who sounded scottish, first attempted to help with a slight attitude i did not at ALL appreciate.  \how can i help you\"" \""i need to make a mortgage loan payment.\"" \""ok..''  long pause as i set the money on the counter.  unsure what she was waiting for i finally said, its not under my name its my husband..  'ok do you have a receipt'  um, no?  'do you have the account number'  no.  then with a heavy sigh and an attitude, she replied \""ok then lets start with what you DO have.\""  so i snapped back.. \""THE MONEY.\""  'hold on.' as she gets her manager..  'she doesnt have any information and she wants to make a mortgage payment.'  so miss manager now partakes in this inconvenient situation.  she tells me that without my name on the account and without an account number she cannot accept the money.  how odd.. i have made the payment myself on three different occasions in which all that was asked was what the name on the account and address to the property was.  her response 'well we cant do that.'  so i went to two different locations with no problem and now you guys suddenly cannot accept a payment because i have no information you claim to need?  'well those locations are not following procedure.'  so you mean to tell me out of three banking locations all over town, you are the ONLY store following policy and procedure?  i highly doubt that. first of all, very unprofessional to throw the other locations under the bus like that, and second, the original teller that was helping could lose the attitude.  then on top of that an employee NOT EVEN INSIDE THE BUILDING AT THE TIME THE SITUATION OCCURED, chased behind me as i left.  lady, i already spoke to two different associates and made it real apparent you guys were inconvenient as all hell, you really think i wanna stop and speak to you? i have shit to accomplish today, and because your bank is SO great at policy and procedure, i now have to go to ANOTHER b of a to complete the transaction.  which i DID by the way.  thanks for nothing, Margarita."""

What we got at Fleming's was a treatment, no treat.  We made reservations for 6:45p, showed up ten minutes early to ensure our seating on time.  When we arrived, we were told our table was being cleared and we would be seated in about ten minutes.  At 7:15, we were still waiting.  With the restaurant jam packed with people stacked at the bar, lounging in the entry way and packed in the dining room, it became obvious that reservations had been overbooked with little chance that anyone would be seated any time soon.

_UChyibLr7HwdNLXKo4oww,"If you want quality shirts fast (they have shirts in their shop to decide upon) at reasonable rates and the BEST (really the best) customer service...you must shop here. We go through shirts so fast because of the products we use on a daily basis, therefore a top-notch t-shirt company that we can continually use is important to us! We ultimately chose Designed In Ink because of their promised quick turn-around time (our previous T-shirt place took so long that by the time we received our zip-up hoodies, we had no need for them because the season had passed). I worked directly with Shelbie who helped calculate the best pricing for our company's needs and we received the shirts within a week or so. The prices were reasonable and the shirts all came out great! We did end up having a snag in terms of the shirts we chose, but Shelbie and her team went above and beyond to make it right...and I can't say that any other company would have done this for us, really. In our opinion, it was the T-shirt brand that we had the issue with but, as I mentioned, Shelbie and her team took the extra steps (and took a loss in profits) to provide the best customer service anyone could ask for.

Expect a portion slightly smaller than you'd like and for the food to be not hot enough.  The Big Ragu at Lansdowne and St Clair doesn't have as hip a vibe but the food is better.  Choose <restaurant>Prop</restaurant> if the atmosphere is more important than the food, although lately it's been feeling a little tired.  The guys smoking out on the patio pre-supper isn't a particular attraction either.  That's the last thing the St. Clair Strip needs, another patio with sketchy smoking men.

At that time I had a candle holder fetish of sorts; that is a whole story in itself.  As one review stated, it is not the cleanest place and yes the isles are narrow; not a bad thing. If the isles were larger then the carts would probably be larger as well and that would mean accidentally buying even more unplanned junk.   But aside from those two things the place is fun.

ZHSMToFUzdVijeJvrWLNJw,"I wrote a review on Joe Mamas earlier today, and on my stroll home, I remembered the good ol' days when I lived up in the Annex.  There was an incognito spot around the corner of Bathurst and Dupont called \The Trane Studio\"".  Similar to Joe Mamas, this spot hosts some VERY talented musicians.  Less pop, more jazz and world music oriented (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWpldjmLIYA), The Trane isn't as flashy as its King St. counterpart, nor is it as consistent.  That said, check their calendar of events (http://tranestudio.com) to find out what's poppin.  They breed a ton of great local talent (see the YouTube clip above), but don't be overwhelmed if Ursula Rucker, or the Soul Jazz Orchestra just so happen to be playing on a night that you're free.  It's nights like those, when the stars align, and you find yourself in the midst of something VERY special.

7RidnmyYyH0cfcX2x7buag,"It's almost the end of the month and we're trying to use up those Entertainment Book coupons.  The 2008 version has three coupons for <restaurant>Siena Bistro</restaurant> and we've been meaning to check out their menu.  Last night provided the perfect opportunity.  It's a bit tricky getting there, thank goodness for the Magellan!  But when you do finally drive up to this place, you'll feel so far away from the busy lifestyle of Las Vegas because after all, it is located on a golf course.  We did a quick check of the menu to make sure there was something we both liked and immediately found a few choices that stood out.  The waiter told us to sit wherever we liked, and the Big F was immediately drawn outside to the fireplace.  After initially seating at one of the inside tables, the waitress asked if we wanted to sit outside since she noticed the Big F had taken a peek.    As we chose our table closest to the fireplace, the waitress quickly set up our table and brought a candle out.  We almost had the outside seating all to ourselves this evening, which was nice.  (The other couple that did sit outside were so engrossed in themselves that it still felt like it was just us!)  The menu had  a nice variety of choices, without being overly expensive either.  After we made our choices, the waitress asked if we wanted any bread and butter, which we immediately said yes to.  The bread took awhile, and we were starving.  But it came out warm - crusty cheese bread rolls with melted Parmesan that were pretty grub.  We each had two and asked for more!  Our entrees were soon to arrive.  We shared:   * <dish>Peppered New York Steak</dish> ($19) \12 oz 5 blended peppercorn marinated bone-in New York steak, <dish>caramelized onions</dish>,  <dish>melted bleu cheese crumble</dish>, <dish>Garlic whipped potatoes</dish>, <dish>chef's vegetables</dish>, and drizzled with a delicate demi-glace.\""  This dish not only looked great, but had so many complementing flavors going on.  The crispiness of the fried onions, the sweetness from the caramelized red onions, the bold taste of the melted bleu cheese, the creaminess of the mashed potatoes, and a pretty tasty piece of beef with peppercorns hidden throughout the meal.  The asparagus and carrots also added to this dish.  I was pretty impressed with this order.  * <dish>T-Bone Lamb Chops</dish> ($18) \""2 pan seared 4 oz <dish>T-bone lamb chops</dish> served with an herb roasted tomato, and white beans.\""  I think I was so focused on the lamb chops part that I missed the 't-bone' part on the menu.  (They also have Lollipop Lamb Chops on the menu too.)  So, I was a bit more surprised when my order came out.  Two chops sat on a bed of white beans with two herb-stuffed Roma tomatoes resting alongside.  The chops were good, but missed something.  It helped with the sweetness of the tomatoes, but I think the white bean concoction drowned out the dish.  It reminded me more of a cassoulet because of the white beans.  I thought the beans were going to be more of a side dish than resting on the whole plate.   Service was decent, considering they were quite busy and we sat outside.  A lot of older people dine here, perhaps because of its location?  We wondered what it would be like during the day so you could check out the view which I'm sure would be gorgeous.  Overall, we were surprisingly pleased.  We saw a few other dishes on our way out and it looked pretty good.  We're still trying to find a way to squeeze in another meal there before our coupon expires.  3.5 stars.  (Pics of our dinner are posted!)""",1
vaueMawiCmQaQutig-Bisw,"I have been here for conferences before, and the MGM always does a great job.  It will be a bummer when I have to pay for parking.  Conference rooms are large. I have enjoyed the food every time. I am always surprised that such a large group of people can all be served pretty much the same meal with consistency.  Bathrooms are clean, but the lines are kinda silly.. I run upstairs, worth it..  I will be back.",1
eMmIawsYRgi0S_4dBsOPoA,"Please please please do not be fooled by the vibrant red, yellow and greens of the Jamaican flag splashed upon the front of this  establishment seemingly beckoning you in.  Your mind will inevitably associate them with melodic reggae music and spicy soulful Caribbean cooking known the world over for tantalizing taste buds, and 9/10 times this association is valid.  The <restaurant>Jerk Spot</restaurant> is a definite exception.   Like many others reviewing The <restaurant>Jerk Spot</restaurant> I do feel a tad guilty about slamming it so as the staff are fantastic.  Yet even the best staff known to man can't save this place from the unpalatable monstrosities that they try to pass off as Caribbean cuisine.  First off the fetid smell that assails your nostrils upon entering can gently be described as a combination of bleach, excrement and rotting carcass.  I know what others may be thinking...why even try food from such a place.  I thought that I would try and follow the old adage and not judge a book by its cover, or in this case an eatery by its smell.  Yet I should have trusted my innate olfactory abilities and avoided consuming anything associated with such a stench.  My <dish>Roti</dish> was a combination of chicken skin, gristle, ground up chicken bones and what I can only assume were small twigs.  Needless to say I took one bite and proceeded to look for the nearest trash receptacle.  I reserve hope that The <restaurant>Jerk Spot</restaurant> hasn't spoiled the opinion of novice Caribbean foodies whose first encounter may have been less than stellar, for as a seasoned vet, I know that the <restaurant>Jerk Spot</restaurant> is a horrific exception and in no way reflects true Island cooking.",1

Great company ethos but I don't need to be breathed on either. I get it. It's Christmas. You've got sales targets. But if I need to know exactly how the fabric breathes, I'll let you know. All sarcasm aside, the staff are pretty passionate here. And free yoga/run classes? That's pretty cool.   I BUY  Ok. So what happened to their classic yoga pants? I've had them for a good five years and boom...all of their yoga pants are of the skinny, scrunchy variety. BOO.  I got a great backpack here as well that fits my laptop. I also wish they had less obstrusive sweatshirts without the massive logo all over the front. As you've proved when you started, less is more. Go back to your basics.

SmYGe2qXVsP8zXjhwJkNBw,"This place is upstairs, connected to the bowling alley called Club 300 Bowl. You may get lost trying to find this place because there are 2 ways in. There is an entrance straight from the parking lot that takes you into the bowling alley, and you just walk down the length and arrive at the restaurant or you go into the plaza and up the stairs or elevator. It is just easier to go from the parking lot but it is an unmarked entrance.  When I first came here, it was bubbling with pots everywhere and there were lots of people. Business has died down a bit but I still think that they're food is pretty good. I mean, how can you actually mess up raw food that patrons cook themselves?   Their sauce bar has a wide selection of different sauces as well as other add ons like seaweed, century eggs, raw eggs, different herbs etc. and it is here that you choose what you want in your soup base, whether it be miso or spicy etc.   There is an upgrade for seafood, it's an extra $4 (I think) for one plate of oysters, salmon, shrimp, scallops and various other things. But you only get this one platter, meaning this portion is not all you can eat.   I'm not a picky hot pot person, if you serve <dish>udon noodles with beef</dish>, I'm pretty much good to go. The udon that they serve here is really good. I think that's why I like coming back here. They do offer the bbq side grill, it's sort of like korean bbq but you also get hot pot at the same time. I rarely ever see anyone take advantage of this option.  They used to have a special with the bowling alley, if you eat at Hot Pot King, and take your receipt, you will get one free soft ice cream cone per person. This used to be the draw and allure of coming here but they have since gotten rid of this option. In its place, they now serve a dessert on the premises. Usually it's a <dish>Chinese papaya dessert soup</dish>, couldn't tell you the name if my life depended on it but it's pretty good, but not as good as ice cream.",1

WgfIuvZB8hIFu6TKvnDnnA,"I came here on a Friday night quite a bit ago after a hard day of work; I brought a few friends from work to enjoy the place. We had a great time!  I wasn't drinking that night, so I can't speak to the libations, but the environment was fantastic. There was a pretty diverse crowd, and the music was excellent; the volume wasn't overpowering, a common feature of many bars like this, unfortunately, though Twist was smart enough to keep the music low enough for people to have a conversation. In addition, they didn't stick to just chart toppers and played an interesting variety of music: Whitney Houston, Olivia Newton John, a few disco hits, and some top 40 stuff. Minimal rap, which I appreciated. There was something for everyone (except the classical music fans, I guess!).  Perhaps more importantly, the crowd felt friendly. My boyfriend and I were able to strike up conversations with a bunch of people in other groups. I understand that's out of the control of the bar, but it mattered to me. A dance floor also seemed to spontaneously form in the large open area of the bar, which was great.  The night was a blast, and I'd love to come back here on another night off!"
mgPUBAHyqA_OOfMgW645dQ,"If you're looking to advance your educational background in hopes of finding a promising career, I have one word for you 'RUN\!!!!  This is hands down one of the worst financial & educational experiences I have ever had!!!   I attended Northcoast back in 2011 & could easily go on for hours about all of the broken promises this \""collage\"" promised during orientation but will try to list just a few examples just to get my point across. The following is taken from a letter of complaint I wrote the owner (whom ignored my request)  in regards to what the school claimed to provide vs. what actually happened.   Northcoast failed to provide the following: 1) State of the art equipment 2) Lack of proper ventilation resulting in exposure to Tectral, sending 1 student to the hospital & causing 8 others to become ill (Tectral has been known to cause cancer). 3) Having 2, possibly 3 different instructors within a 10 week time period! 4) Failure to provide students with a reliable instructor during 3rd quarter (ex: one instructor having to teach two classes at once in separate rooms).  5) Paying for supplies for demonstrations such as \""Swine Dissection\""  but being told we were not covering this due to \""not enough time\"" and \""I forgot to order the pigs\"". Yet not receiving a refund!   This place is an absolute joke! They DO NOT assist you with job placement! They DO NOT offer tutoring! Etc, and worst of all; I had an interview with Primary Petcare Center & had the manager said  \"" I only have two concerns...one of them being where you received your education from, Northcoast\"".... \"" We've worked with their students for job shadowing before and well,.... the girl fainted on us. We just haven't had a good experience with students from there\"". Awesome, right?!    Again, if anyone would like more details as to what went on while I attended I'd be more than happy to speak with you. And if anyone is seriously considering becoming a Veterinary Assistant- don't!  You will NEVER make more than minimum wage, you will be luckily if you can find a full time position and most places will hire you without the degree. You are better off becoming a Vet Tech or an actual Veterinarian."""
EN7geLypGKiJ9PD3Wtdl0A,"I am done with this place!   First off when it was Bright Horizon it was nice. I felt comfortable leaving my then 4 month baby there. But ever since Imagination Station things went down hill...fast. What everyone is saying about the price going up, the promises, the cleanliness, and more are all true. I let so many things go but I finally had enough, after all this is my child we are talking about. The first incident was her missing outfit. Keep in mind we are supposed to label clothing and things..ok that's fine. I just purchased an outfit for my daughter and decided to put it on her and take her to daycare. When I picked her up her clothes were changed. I get it, she had an accident, no problem. I get home and her outfit I dressed her in wasn't in her bag. So I'm thinking ok it's still there and I'll get it tomorrow. The next day no one can find it. Since we only went two days a week, I had to wait until the following week. Again no outfit and a \I'm sorry\"". I ended up bringing in a picture of the outfit so they could hang it. They said it could have been placed in someone else's bag. Long story short my daughter's outfit was never found. Management was ZERO help and said they were not liable. And even asked if her name was on it?! No it wasn't because it was ON HER! It is their responsibility to make sure whatever the child came there with, it should be returned to them.   So, I let it slide because we needed daycare.  Not long after that the jar food I sent with her was \""missing\"". The teacher claimed it wasn't in the bag. It made me second guess myself. I have a nightly routine and packing her bag was one of them. I KNEW I packed two containers of food and I add the bottles in the morning. But still I checked my car (knowing it wasn't in there\"", and I checked once I got home. I immediately knew which food was missing. It frustrated me 1. because my child didn't eat it and 2. you say it was never in the bag.  Again, I let it go.  The very next week I take her in and mind you there are different teachers each week. My daughter was scheduled for the 5:30am-3:30pm shift. I walk in and check in and a \""new\"" teacher approached me saying the infant teacher doesn't come in until 6am. I'm confused. How is that my problem? Why are you even telling me? Apparently she had another child in another room. Again...how is that my problem? She took my daughter and I left and went to work. I didn't know it at the time but the last day I took my daughter there, I handed her off to yet another \""new\"" teacher. This one had very long finger nails. Too long in my opinion to have when you work with infants. That upset me. Anyway I pick her up and I'm watching them put everything in her bag but I noticed the third bottle was not there. She told me it was only two bottles. I said no I always put three in her bag. Finally we found it, still in the bag, which meant it was left out all day. So I had to throw it away and was officially done with them.   DONE!   There were times when I picked her up and I'm counting babies vs teachers and was shocked. I counted 7 babies including my own and two teachers once. I had to stand there and wait because they were both feeding babies. I'm not sure what the teacher vs child ratio is but I'm pretty sure that's not right. What if something happened?   We were VERY fortunate to find better child care for our daughter. It felt soo good telling them she will not be coming back! I am no longer stressed going to work because I know my baby is in very good hands and is safe.   I strongly recommend you find a better daycare for your precious angles and trust your gut when you sense something isn't right.  Normally I would apologize for the rant but in this case I won't because I'm hoping I can save another family from making the same mistake we did."""

OiKyWxdAvPUS70JTWZX5CQ,"I have been to Hand and Stone before so I'm familiar with the set up but this was my first time visiting this location which opened up earlier this year.

I had a 50min hot stone massage which started promptly (both the owner came to introduce the RMT to me). Hand and Stone's hot stone massage is an \""active\"" massage where they take the stones (they have various sizes) and massage you with them (as opposed to some place which simply place them on your back and massage around them). Like almost all the Hand and Stone massage I've received, I love the little consistent details (heated massage table, room is always warm and a nice temperature) so I've never really had a bad experience trying someone new. My RMT was Craig and he also had some nice details (great hand/foot massage with some pressure point/stretching and I liked how for some parts he covered me entirely with the sheets to give you that comfy, snuggle in massage feeling) with great pressure throughout. He was probably a little vigorous for me (I'm generally more the sleepy relaxing massage type) but again, that's just personal preference and I can see people who need a sports/deep tissue massage really liking his style.  The only drawback was that the lounge area was a bit small and in the main traffic area (as opposed to the Leaside location which has the couches/magazine somewhat to the side) so while you're waiting for your massage, it's not as relaxing as it could be. Otherwise, I was very happy with my service here!"""

The selection of wine, beer and alcohol is extensive with many brands that I didn't recognize. The aisles are narrow and it takes some jostling for two carts to pass one another. Prices on popular products are market price, no better than Woodman's. Discounts are offered on select 6 bottle wine purchases. I didn't notice case discounts for alcohol. This may be due to their liquor license that only allows 4 liters of alcohol to be purchased on one receipt. If you're stocking up for a party be warned that you will be making multiple transaction at the check out. It won't endear you to the customers waiting behind you and what is the point if you just have multiple purchases at checkout?  In addition to alcohol they have a small cheese and meat cooler with a nice selection of boars head products. Other impulse worthy items are glassware, ice picks, cocktail accessories and minatures. Be wary, not all are priced.  There is a large cigar humidor that I didn't check out and so cannot comment on It.  It's new and worth a checking out. I'm not a fan of the mall so it won't be my first choice for my next beer run. Once the novelty wears off I'm not sure the shop local crowd will keep it on their radar."

So much for having a place to live with 5 dogs and a 4 year old on top of being pregnant because I have no money for rent,  food etc now that they closed my account."

The voucher was going to expire at the end of the month and I still had yet to be able to make an appointment as they seem to be always booked.   On Friday, I called again to inquire about a spot on the weekend or during the week in the evening.  No luck.  The receptionist told me, they had only appointments in the morning.  When I mentioned that I never have time during the day since I work full time, she advised me to talk to my boss about taking time off for the salon!   Really??  When I declined, she transferred me to the salon manager (owner?). I explained my issue with the available time slots vs. my work and she told me that they were willing to honor the voucher after the 30th  - but I would have to pay a $35 \""service fee\"".  She then proceeded to tell me that I should take the offer since \""this is still cheaper than paying for the mani/pedi individually\"". I was actually kind of speechless.  I contacted Fabfind for a refund."""

Now this statement may sound a little dramatic but when you use a seamstress as often as I do, partnering up with one like Janet feels like a miracle.  It's not just the quality of her very reasonably priced work that makes me drive 20 mins (one way) but also her personality.  She's proven to be trust worthy, flexible, accommodating, incredibly friendly and a great laugh too.  I can be very particular and detailed orientated and Janet has always been able to manage that.

What I wasn't ready for, however, was one of the worst meals I have had in recent memory.  Three of us ordered the lunch <dish>Bento Box</dish>, and while I'll spare you the details, the gastrointestinal horror that followed is one for the books.  First and foremost, the food took 20+ minutes to arrive, which is amazing, considering that the only thing in the box that requires any form of real cooking would be the chicken or shrimp.  Lo and behold, a barebones bento box with our choice of sparse protein, a salad so tragic that Shakespeare himself could not have crafted it (several day old wilted lettuce, what seems like 3/4 wilted mint, and a few drops of dressing), sushi that you could get at a gas station, and extremely dry white rice.  My friend's <dish>chicken satay</dish> was nearly raw, and our shrimp was obviously drowned in garlic in order to mask the fact that the seafood was definitely not the freshest.  I cannot fault the server, as he was trying his best to accomodate us. That being said, he did mention that they were making huge changes in the kitchen and would be changing the menu shortly.  I would avoid this restaurant at all costs. I'm not one to say this, but this has to be the worst example of price-point I have ever seen. Know your lane and stick to it.",1

JcR-zY-wT42QWsD3f5NzRA,"I'm having a hard time wondering if I should write this review or not, but I think people should know a little about the experience they may have at this salon. I've been to see Coy about 3-4 times now and each time I've enjoyed getting to know him.  Coy promotes the products encouragingly (it's borderline pushy..) and refers to himself as a product guy.  He's very interested in what products you use, etc., but oftentimes when people come for a hair cut.. that's .... well it really.  I don't particularly enjoy the pushy product sales, especially when you get to the counter and they're all lined up - about 150$ worth of products that you basically have to say YE or NE to.  Gets kind of awkies. For me, personally, this last time I went I felt like my hair cut was rushed as Coy had to get home.  He pulled out his phone twice to text with his significant other.  I felt like our conversation was insincere and interrupted often to focus on personal matters.  My trim only takes about 30-40 minutes so there really is no need to haul out phones to text.  A few facts about Edges people should also note: - My trims with Coy are $75 a cut - Edges charges a $1.50 recycling fee with every service (which I find incredibly bizarre for a salon) I really like Coy as a person and think he has a lot of potential to be an incredible, reputable stylist, there just needs to be some polishing in terms of professionalism and making a guest feel like they're having an amazing salon experience.  For $75 a cut, I don't feel like I got that experience and would prefer to go somewhere where I don't feel like I'm less important than personal priorities."

They've got a pretty extensive menu, but I opted for the <dish>Big Texan</dish> (sauteed mushrooms & onions, crisp bacon, cheddar cheese, and hickory-smoked BBQ sauce). After placing my order, I looked over at the grill and noticed that there was already a fully-cooked burger sitting there. I thought to myself, there's no way they're gonna use that patty for mine.  They used that patty.  I braced myself for the worst and took my burger back to one of the many tables in the food court. As you might've guess from the list of toppings, the Big Texan is an exceedingly messy affair and I was ultimately happy that I remembered to grab a fork before sitting down. The plentiful toppings, which are all quite tasty, prove effective at masking the dry patty, and I did, as a result, enjoy the hamburger more than I thought I would. It just would've been nice if the meat had been cooked to order.",1

6o0ebinmRihldKicF_jYSg,"I'm pretty disgusted at this point. At first, we were happy--but not now.   We bought a 2019 Jeep Cherokee on 9/28/2018. Papers were signed, but we couldn't take the Jeep. We were told we could on Saturday. When I called Saturday, they were going through an \audit\"" and couldn't release the truck to us. We didn't get it until the Wednesday. Our only vehicle had been totaled-our rental was up on Monday--and they knew it  When we were in getting financing, there was an additional $1700 charge for VIN etching (which was already done before we got the truck), \""Desert Protection Package\"" (we were told that covers anything to the inside and outside of your car as long as it wasn't done by acid or gas), and window tint protection. I told them we didn't want it--the finance manager insisted that it was part of the deal. I kept insisting I didn't want it, but we ended up getting it because we thought it was part of the pricing on the car (last new car we bought was in NY--we never had this so we assumed it was an Arizona thing--it's not--it's an add on they made it seem that it was required--DO NOT BE PRESSURED INTO GETTING IT!)  Two days after we took possession of the truck, a can of paint that was not sealed correctly leaked on to the back passenger seat rug. I called the sales person who we dealt with immediately, and he told me it was covered. He said he would call me back. No call Friday. I texted him Saturday and asked if he spoken to the service department. He said he would get back to me. Nothing.   I finally called Saturday afternoon to the service department, spoke with a female, told her what happened and I needed to make an appointment. I asked her if it was covered under the \""Desert Protection Plan\"" and she said yes   So I bring the truck in--and guess what-it's not covered.   So we paid $400 for VIN etching that was done BEFORE we got the truck--which is supposed to cover you if your car is stolen (that's what car insurance is for), $400 for tint protection on the windows (which I can get done cheaper than that), and $1000 on some \""Desert Protection Plan\"" that people say things are covered when they're not.   They breached their contract when two people misrepresented the service they would cover under the \""Desert Protection Plan\"" verbally to me.   So we got ripped off for $1700 for something they represented was required when they sold us the truck and I argued I DIDN'T want (and obviously doesn't cover what they represent it does); they held our vehicle for five days due to an \""audit\"" when it's apparent they wanted to post the sale number for October; and they tried to sell us some $3100 warranty that I argued with them until they found a cheaper one.   Unless this is made right, I suggest no one go here.  UPDATE: Was promised a call back by management on 10/9/2018. 24 hours later--no call back."""

Fshzho1bJRKu2J8qmTamSw,"I purchased a bed frame on the Internet.  Somehow I ordered the wrong size.  I had initially picked queen size, but when entering I unknowingly picked double.  Maybe it was me, or maybe it was the confusion in their ordering process  - no matter the result was a nightmare.  While the order was incorrect and it was my mistake, the follow up was less than perfect - way less.   I ended up keeping the frame.  Why, it cost almost as much \out of pocket\"" costs to return it as the refund amount stated.  Expensive to return, plus I would have had to pay a \""restocking\"" fee.    The phone number on the incoming shipping label was wrong.  Later I was told the address on the return label that was originally sent might be wrong.   As I researched this company I wasn't able to find a website, and the BBB had posted that this This Business is not BBB accredited. http://www.bbb.org/wisconsin/business-reviews/furniture-manufacturers/epic-furnishings-llc-in-madison-wi-1000015540  All of this seemed to risky and troublesome to attempt to recuperate about $20."""

At an event consultant for a local business, I see florists come and go every week. This florist sticks shines above much of the local competition. If you want something truly unique and inspired I would wholeheartedly recommend Green Sinner.  Update: My husband and I decided to get married in the summer of 2017 and of course my first and only choice was Jimmy's team. I asked for very little, just an earthy floral crown, boutonnière and bouquet for our ceremony by the lake. What the team gave me was more my vision than even I could have conveyed.

1Dp_zUe2P4vfPMJ8ZmR_pA,"I mean WOW and not in a good way..... This Dr Robinson makes the fictional character Doctor House seem like a warm cuddly teddy bear in comparison. He has pictures of himself all over the office throwing in your face how he is a martial arts expert, yet he shows nothing of being humble, open, nor peaceful. He is angry, short tempered and highly judgmental. He has no problem treating you like dirt if you cannot afford a prestigious insurance. Heck he will really make you feel horrible if you have to pay out of pocket due to a laps of insurance, especially when you get insurance through your employer. He treats you like you are a waste of his time and talks down to you. He has no problem storming into the room, berate you, write a quick prescription, and snap at you saying he is done, and just walk right out. Does not give you a chance to speak one word! If you are made of money and wear fancy clothes, I am sure he will be cordial with you. Beware if you are working class though, he hates the working class! At least this is the impression he gives me! I have seen him twice and never again! Both times I was polite, respectful, and gave him no reason to behave toward me the way he did. He does not deserve to be in practice. Maybe he needs to spend more time with his Sensei or change his Dojo all together, because whatever he is learning, it has done nothing but sour him like a rotted lemon."

The store provides a great specialty outlet and the customer service is responsive, however, I have two main problems with the store, which is why I will not return and neither will my african-american friend. We were immediately identified as trouble in my opinion. Its hard to describe that subtle feeling, but there was definitely an uncomfortable and awkward feeling coming from the employees, a young blonde female in particular. Regardless of the unquantifiable feeling of suspiciousness toward your person, the fact is we were not dressed as street people or went in with menacing glares, but they requested to hold onto my laptop case and my friend's purse. Being in a good mood, I ignored it, but it was hard to ignore when there were other women holding bags and purses and our property was the only one being held at the front. I left thinking, damn, that was racist. I won't return. On a side note, I don't think the value of the materials and goods are worth the cost either. I saw a hat for 80 dollars which came with an owner's guide...owner's guide...seriously."

OPMXANnABpgiA2m0IHDXXQ,"I bought a new unit from Mesa 2 years ago and loved their service. However, I had some problems with it keeping up with the hot and humid weather we have been experiencing in Vegas.  The older gentleman got up on my roof and checked things out, came down and told me that everything is looking fine and the unit is working as expected.  I asked him why would it not keep up? He explained that the new refrigerant 410A does not work the same as the old R-22 and that it actually loses some of its cooling abilities especially when it is humid and hot.  He explained that he has lived in the Vegas Area since 1970 and has never seen the humidity so high during the hottest portion of the year (I agreed since I've been here for 25 years)   This was in direct conflict with the Silverstate Refrigeration tech that came out the day before. He said there was a possible blockage, need to replace the drier filter, and the compressor because it was probably damaging the compressor too. (Hmmm) He said that my unit was under warranty, which I knew but gave me an estimate of $1200 for labor.  Just spoke with him and told him to not come out to fix it.  Wow! Living in Las Vegas you need to watch this stuff all the time."

ixQBmmpmWl6wW5D3pJdv6A,"I originally was shopping for a home theater system about 15 years ago.  I had small kids and knew that going to movies wasn't a great option.  Most companies were quoting $15K to $20K systems to start.  I then met with John at Audio Contractors.  He was able to get me a great system for half of what the others wanted.  I asked why he was so reasonable, and I'll never forget what he said.  He said that Audio Contractors is looking for long-term customers and by treating us right, they hope that we keep coming back.  They were right.  I've continued to upgrade through the years and couldn't be happier with their service and knowledge. The sales reps I've worked with, Jamie and Andrew, are always responsive and listen to my needs to come up with viable solutions.  The technicians are also very professional and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Audio Contractors for any home theater needs."

ptZKX4YYmh_F69Vt2R_tkw,"Update On This Nightmare!!!!!! How Does This Company Stay In Business? After many phone calls to the corporate office and the Charlotte NC office I finally have an appt. on May 22nd to have all the carpet Empire installed replaced. I am more than a little worried about having them back in my home! I ask Empire to just put laminate in the upstairs hallway since this is the only area where the seams have come apart. They can't replace just the hallway because they can't match the rest of the carpet, this seemed like a reasonable request and solution for both parties. The hallway is only about 6x12.  Well, Empire wanted to Charge me extra to install the laminate unless I agreed to use one of only three samples they sent out by an installer on his way to another job not by a sales rep. The three samples all looked the same Maple color and matched nothing in my home. When I tried to explain this I was told that's the only choices I get unless I want to pay extra. What a joke! After everything these people have put me through they have the audacity to ask for more money!!!!  I'm not sure how replacing all the carpet upstairs and the carpet on the staircase is more cost effective for Empire than installing laminate in a 6x12 area but nothing surprises me anymore with this company!  This entire  process has been a nightmare from the start and I just want it finished. I will have someone in my home  who knows more than I do about carpet and installation and did it for a living,  to oversee the work this time.   I will update with results after and if second installation is complete."
kPX8Dn1M3rC-zEewOrnNXg,"Over the years, my teeth have shifted back to the way they were before i had braces. Being i was so young when i got my braces off, i didn't keep track of my retainers and felt invincible, like oh my mouth will be finnnne. Toward the end of college i noticed that was not the case.  I have been waiting to get them corrected for some time now. I had seen an add for SDC on a few sites. Considering this a sign, i booked an apt. I was able to get an apt the same day! When i arrived, i only waited a couple minutes and was brought into the office. The office was in a building with other businesses, not sure what that is called, but it was a joint business building with a variety of businesses. Hope that makes sense. Anywayyy. There, i finished up paperwork/ digi Work with my autographs. They asked me questions for contraindications and so on. I was then brought into the second room where they would do the scan. The consultant explained the machine, the procedure, what to expect, how the mouth pieces work. She showed me what i will be receiving in the mail and what the box will include, how the process works. She then took a few photos of my mouth. After the photos, she started the scanning process. The process was completed with a wand like tool, that was wired to a screen. The scanning was honestly very fascinating! When she was completed the screen showed my entire tooth/mouth as 3D! I was pretty impressed. The scans are then sent to a dentist that will analyze the scans and create the aligners. That's it! You don't have to go into the office again!  You can also do all of this via mail and send in a mold of your mouth. However, if there is a nearby location, they recommend going in, because the scan is more accurate. And any questions you have can be asked right there. There are a couple payment options (which i found very affordable). If you do a single pay, which includes ALL the aligners you would need with the $250 lab fee waived would be $1850. The second option is $80 a month for 24 months. $80 flat rate. No matter how many aligners you would need! The aligners are both top and bottom so your bite is normal. The package includes a whitening system as well, with a fancy light. After your finished with Your aligners, you can order a retainer to maintain your smile... from what i said before, i highly recommend the retainer! I will modify this review as the processes continues. I am now waiting for my box. The box will be at my door within the next 4 or so weeks!"

_tLXitzH3v8_H-usIKhKXA,"I came in a disaster. I HAD hair down to my waist and asked my (previous) \stylist\"" for an ombré.. She bleached it from natural dark, almost black, to screaming hot almost white. In tears at the end and couldn't leave quickly enough. (Still wish I could find her on yelp to help warn future customers.) Tried some at-home deep-conditionings but the ends continued to break off like glass. I needed to find someone quick and close by that might be able to help, and came across Krissy's Groupon for Divine Hair Salon. Awesome reviews, and I figured might as well go in for a consult (worst case scenario, just chop it off and save the embarrassment of going out in public the way my hair already was)  We talked on the phone, I explained the disaster, came in and was greeted right away (she was waiting at the front for me)! She told me what the other stylist did wrong and said sorry it happened.. I asked her to save as much of my hair as she could and she really did take her time snipping off only what she needed to and then cleaned up any leftover blotchiness with a super natural-looking ombré. Even though she did have to cut a bit, I was still not disappointed and couldn't believe she was able to repair it the way she did. I brought my sister in a couple weeks later bc she wanted a \""big change\"". Krissy made sure she knew exactly what my sister wanted before she started and my sister loved her new style! During her deep conditioning, she even came out to see my hair again and ask if it settled in the way I wanted :) Such a nice lady who really cares about what her customer wants, no product pushing or unnecessary additions to mark up the price either.. Loved the cute salon as well! I've recommended her over and over and everyone's happy so far :)"""

n4E833buxa0ZC6Jta7nM3w,"<restaurant>Bakery On The Go</restaurant>, its located in Warden Station, which makes it convenient when you want to have a little snack while waiting for the bus. The prices are reasonable, for the types of food items that are offered. They open early and close late, meaning you can get something in the morning and evening. With that said, if you are purchasing a snack in the evening, they are generally leftovers from the day; this means they aren't the freshest. Finally, if your looking for award winning customer service, well, look somewhere else- the service level varies- depends on who assists you and their mood.    Personally, I sometimes treat myself to a <dish>cinnamon-bun</dish> or a <dish>vegetarian patty</dish>. I've tried the <dish>beef patty</dish>, and ended up with indigestion."

Doable. -Different sides and additional toppings available (e.g. fries, wedges, onion rings) -Quick delivery (Ordered at 9:55. Arrived at 10:15)  Cons:  -The foooood. It's really blah. For lack of a worse word to describe blahness.  Nothing extreme about that burger except my disappointment- the blue cheese\ was not the crumble you might expect but the same runny sauce used as a dip.   The wings were so hot they were rendered tasteless. Nothing jerk about them except the chefs pretending to know a thing about jerk seasoning.  Only my can of pop didn't fail me.  More cons:  -$3 delivery fee. Muuur. -Charge for the yucky dips, one should be included with wings -No deals. No 3-drinks for leas or any kind of deal to drive sales. This place could use a repricing strategy.  I RECOMMEND- a&w burger or something   EXTRA TIP- As ordered on just-eat.ca""",1
750E29lQdlg1mkN8RPIZbg,Great service! Waz was on time and took the time to explain what he was going to do.  His prices are extremely reasonable as well. Would recommend to friends. My only feedback would be to buy your dimmers in advance if you plan to have one installed.

Dr. K is a professional who truly cares about his patients and their well being. He asks all the right questions and he never fails to listen. He's kind, courteous and he takes the time to get to know his patients. I appreciate his time and all of the helpful recommendations he's made. If you're looking for affordable, professional chiropractic care, look no further."

dwQEZBFen2GdihLLfWeexA,"This is my all time favorite Mexican restaurant. I've been coming here since they opened in 2002 (I think). I can't say enough good things about this place. The food is always hot and fresh. You can eat all the chips and salsa you want, and they make it all fresh daily. The staff is super friendly and attentive. I eat here almost once a week so that tells you how much I enjoy this restaurant. I would estimate that I've eaten here more than 450 times over the past 14 years and I've never had a bad meal. So I guess I'm a big fan and highly recommend it.",1
86PQRj-tc8vLsWwQzHx_mg,"This is the best groomer we have ever been to. We take our two dogs and cat here and will not be going anywhere else again. Our cat can have a bit of an attitude but is never scared or tense when she comes/ goes here, so I am certain that she is treated well by the staff. Our dogs are doodles and we have their feet shaved into poodle feet to cut down on mess in the house. The younger one doesn't love having her feet shaved and other groomers have not been able to shave them because she was difficult, Petsburgh was able to shave her feet with no issues. Overall my dogs always look great, better than anywhere else they have gone - and it has been more reasonably cost than anywhere I've been. They are accommodating with my schedule and even send me text updates. I definitely recommend giving them a try!"
6OV-xbmgjdXUZ80BdjXfJQ,"I ate here this past Thursday night with my girlfriend for <occasion>dinner</occasion>.  The inside of the restaurant is split up half into a bar type area and half into a dining room.  There are TVs everywhere and the dining room has a huge projection onto a screen.  The night that we went there was also live entertainment and we heard they have it every thursday and Saturday with karaoke on Friday.  My only complaint was the band was so loud I could hardly hear our waitress talk and could not understand any of the specials.  My girlfriend and I both decided to start off our evening with the <dish>beer cheese soup</dish>.  It came in a crock with a pretzel stick and man was it awesome.  Hot and gooey with a nice cheese flavor and a hint of beer.  It was perfect to combat how cold it was in the restaurant where even the hostess was wearing a jacket.  Even though it was sort of redundant with my appetizer, I decided to go with the <dish>buffalo chicken Mac and cheese</dish> which was the #1 seller according to the menu.  My meal came with a <dish>salad</dish> with which I ordered balsamic dressing.  The <dish>salad</dish> was nice but the dressing was a sesame dressing and not a balsamic.  My girlfriend ordered the <dish>salmon salad</dish> for her entree and had the same dressing issue although she also enjoyed it.  The mac and cheese ended up being good with the chicken shaved on top with a dry rub on it and the pasta with a buffalo cheese sauce on it.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably head back here in the future.  The food was good but I would probably head back on a night without live entertainment as it was too loud and I also hope the restaurant is warmer.",1
byYbmnfna-uxrNFIdJUiCQ,"When my x husband died without a will I needed help quick (our 8 year old twins inherited the huge mess he left behind). I asked a friend who had recently had his father pass away and he recommended this firm. When I had my first issue (which was basically LACK OF RESPONSE) I should have found someone else, but I didn't. I hoped for the best and had already written a sizable retainer check. A year and a half later all I can say is WHAT A NIGHTMARE. I have to follow up with them repeatedly, I have waited up to 56 days for a response (and never got one - had to follow up AGAIN). My answers are never thoroughly answered and even though I have resorted to listing my questions in numbered form and asking that each be answered in turn, some remain unanswered. All I can say if that if you need help with probate and conservatorship with minors THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. Perhaps they have 5 star service for other areas of the law but not this one (granted I realize my situation is unique and not \cookie cutter\"" but no one paying anyone thousands of dollars should ever have to wait months for a response. Note: I planned to write my yelp review when probate was finally closed because: 1) I feared the service I got would only get worse and 2) I hoped they would redeem themselves. But my most recent email \""waiting game\"" has left me so dismayed I thought that if I could save one person from the experience I am having, I should speak up."""

YFLjSScUquPLbdpmLX8G8Q,Ace Detailing is located in the Toronto Shangri La Hotel. You enter from the Simcoe side and it may be best to pull up to the hotel and then let the bellman know you are heading to the Ace Spa for auto treatment.   They took my car and 3 hours later returned a brand new vehicle - my 2006 car was as new: or at least to my eyes and nose. My wife and I were thrilled.   Since my car had not been detailed since it was purchased I opted for the $179 package - washing and shampooing and scrubbing. This is money well spent and I do not plan on having another treatment for another 4 years.   Salt accumulation on the floor - gone. Floor mats - clean. Nooks and crannies - clean as a whistle.    Very pleased.
ZtPzdwBq1dQaUIQnPKa-Qw,"I don't know whose life this is fit for, but it isn't mine! I'm an area with a multitude of great lunch options, this place tends to fall short.   Bloor/Yonge lunch places pride themselves on giving you a whole bunch of food for not a lot of money, so it's almost a foreign concept to feel cheated of portions. However, they are very, VERY cheap when it comes to things like toppings. I ordered a turkey club panini, that came with lettuce, tomatoes, and I could count the individual cooked onions they sprinkled on top. I also asked for jalapeños, and got 3 small slices. I mean, I get it, they can't give me a mountain of food, but having enough toppings to cover most of the surface area of my sammich seems standard, no? Anyhow, I paid for my sandwich, but noticed a fatal flaw: no bacon! So I had to take it back. They were very nice about it and offered to make me a new sandwich. However, new sandwich didn't have those jalapeños I had originally wanted. This sounds like a \so what suck it up millennial princess\"" moment, but here's the rub: the sandwich had no flavour without them. The turkey, bacon, bread, and veggies all just tasted like cardboard. (I have ordered this sandwich before and remember thinking \""this is decent!\"", so maybe it was just an off sandwich).  My friend orders boxes here and swears by them. Maybe they are a better bet, but with so many options in the area I don't know if I can survive more lunchappointment. That's disappointment in lunch. I made it up, so what?"""

I've been seeing him for almost two years and he delivered my son in March and I hope for him to be there to deliver my current pregnancy, my daughter! He's very caring and he listens to you... he's been doing his job for a long long time so he has pretty quick answers for you. With my son he scheduled me to be induced at the hospital while he was going to be doing his rounds there so he knew he would be there for me. He knew how terrified I was! He came and checked on me when he arrived at the beginning of his shift there then he delivered my son and checked on me before he left! He said I did great and I got a picture of him holding my son which I will not post for privacy reason but he looked so happy, that's what you need to look for in a dr! He really enjoys his job delivering babies and he's very good at it! And once he was in the room I felt relief and it made the rest of my few pushes and clean up easier and less stressful! ** I have been close to searching for another dr ONLY because of the office staff at the Sahara location but it's mainly the girls that answer the phones I have a problem with.. so I got over that bump and decided to stick with dr scarff himself because he is such a great dr! He's the one doing the work and seeing you for you pregnancy or annual check ups or whatever else it may be... so if you see yourself having that problem with the staff just remember how great of a dr he is and that they are not the ones treating you."
1YxLacCdn4yYQDPUzdye8g,Not in the best area. This place is convenient and gets the job done but the attention to detail was lacking. I had oil and a tire change done. After getting into my car I noticed they had not reset the tire pressure and oil warnings so I had to go back in to have them do this. Service is a bit slow as well. Good thing I was able to drop it off for the day.

This is one to which he will definitely return -- His hair does look and smell amazing.  Mario cut his hair and my husband said that he doesn't even realize how good he is.   Totally a guy's place -- the decor is that of an old garage, with tool chests for barber stations and garage style sinks.  Very cool.  Clean and nice and they got him in quickly.  Be sure to hit this place up during the week as weekends you can expect to wait at least an hour as scruffy men are lined out the door waiting for a good cleanup."

22KhRbe8X8DuSJrVawcXSQ,"We needed a new water heater as we were seeing corrosion at the bottom. On October 26th, we had three companies come out to give us estimates. The first estimate was crazy expensive. Don from Water Heaters Only came out a couple of hours later and gave us an estimate that was $500 less. He also had a replacement water heater with him so he could do the repair at the time. Don also took the time to explain that the current water heater was actually too large for the space it was in so the replacement was a bit taller but a slimmer water heater to it fit the space better. He would also be adding a drip pan and tubing so we would be able to monitor any potential issues in the future. Another company came out during the same time but gave us same cost as the first company. Water Heaters Only had the best pricing plus Don took the time to explain everything to us. I would definitely recommend them to anyone needing a new water heater. Best choice we made."

AK4FuPTFWFRPxSyRxzwiNA,"I'm the second to write a review.   My experience is the opposite.   I've been taking my Seitz Tzu for years starting in 2005.  I could not get in there until summer after the snowbirds left.  They have had great groomers, and not so great.  I know they have had a turn over, and I think I know why.   Tips are an important part of the groomers pay.   In Sun City West, were they are located, will not tip.  I usually tip $5.00 to groomer and $5.00 to bather.   The last time I was there my budget was was short, I apologized that $2.00 each is all I could give.   They were delighted with my tip, telling me how bad it was.    Groomers make more tips outside of Sun Cities.   This explains why it coast so much at Grand Grooming, they have to keep raising their fees to keep the good groomers, as will as rising expenses.  I have wondered why it is so easy now to get an appointment.  I used to have to make appointments weeks in advance, now it is 1 to 2 days.   I blame NOT Grand Grooming owner, but her customer bass.  If each of them could cough up $2.00 ($1.00 ea.), or $4.00 (better), good groomers would probably stay.      Granting what the gentle man said is true, no matter ware you go you take a chance.  Grand Grooming management dose care, that is very important.  I have no problem in sending friends to them, nor suggesting they leave a tip.  Help them keep good groomers, by tipping and knowing your groomer.  I used the same person for years, I now know why she is not there any longer."

DGDBFpZk-NIvah4M7MtDDg,"Stayed at this hotel. While hanging out at the casino, got hungry and didn't feel like driving out for something to eat especially when we just wanted something small in the meantime before dinnertime. So decided to grab a slice of <dish>pizza</dish> (a vegetarian combo - olives, spinach, tomato slices and onions). It was a pretty large slice and pretty costly at about $6 with tax but its on the strip and in a hotel casino so it wasn't too bad in that case. In fact, it was worthwhile as the <dish>pizza</dish> was actually pretty darn good. A bit on the greasy side though but as weird as I am, I get napkins to Hubby and little brother stole a few bites from me too for that reason and they both loved it. I would have taken a picture but we inhaled it before I remembered to do so. Opps.   They also have quick grab and go sandwiches, salads, caprese salads and fruit cups. They have specials which is $8 for a slice a pizza, garlic bread and a beer which isn't too shabby at all. Place was pretty roomy so not much long wait time. You can eat in also like a cafeteria style place.  Will definitely come back whenever I need a quick bite without having to leave the hotel to get it.",1

Cat1JuOOdv89E8Zck23smQ,"Laura has been cutting my hair for over two years now. As a young professional, I've played it safe my whole life by going to places like supercuts and the like. My first appointment with her was a true eye opener. I've never had a hair stylist or barber spend more than 15 minutes on my hair. Laura took the time to understand what I wanted and made suggestions. My hair now is completely different now than when I first visited her (in a good way!). I can't imagine going back to a haircut mill; there is no way those places can offer the attention, skill, and friendliness that Laura offers.. To this day, I religiously schedule with her every 4 weeks."
6giph4fUQvkgPdHr2YqzbA,"Disc golf course is a great place for people just getting into the game. Few trees come into play and no permanent water hazards, but this is a river bed so you might avoid it after rains. There are lots of drives from up high so it's a great place to feel good about the longer distances you can achieve because of that. Bring a decently Insulated canteen with you as you start and finish near the restroom/drinking fountain but you're well away from them over the course of your game. My game wasn't great but the time there with a group of 8 of us playing today was outstanding."
0pc2ne4htN-dm0kw2WJfXQ,Went for a hair cut . My hair looked the same as when I got there. I told her I didn't like it and she cut some more off but I have to say it's the worse haircut  I've had.

9UTlCIkrtvDrY3A-Orn5DQ,This store is run by children! Rude ones at that! Went into store to look around. I was at the cabinet at the front. A young man finally came over to assist me. He took a few items out the cabinet for me. I wanted one and he put is aside for me. Then he walked away. Rude Child!!! Terrible Customer Service.  Hire Adults.   I waited for 5 minutes for someone else to help me. I had to call out and ask for help AGAIN!! Finally a young lady came over. Had me go to an actual register and I was able to complete my purchase.   Whoever is the Manager of this store. You need to keep on top of your employees.  Every time I come here.  These children are taking and joking around instead of Working!!! Next time I am going to record them and post it here on Yelp!

I called this company at the last minute. I originally booked with another company and cancelled them since they were not calling back and responding to me. The price was better, the communication was as well.  Great job!"

Upcharge on product is ridiculous.  They don't charge by time they charge by the job.  SO they are making almost $200/rd when you do the math on what project entails.    I work 90 plus hours a week.  I needed help getting fridge fixed, so I decided to pay their ridiculous fees.  They said product would take 7-10 days to come in, when I never heard from them, but did get credit card bill I called and they said they had my repair part.  Scheduled appointment and they never showed up?  Never called?  I took an entire day off of work to get repair fixed.  Did I mention they have you pay for service before they get the job done.    Run for the hills, these guys are not worth the headache."

vw9Mi29Y8oL5a8wgP820kQ,"Most bars in Old Brooklyn that I've visited are dives: usually aged, don't have food beyond doritos or hot dogs, don't offer micros on draft.  <restaurant>Memphis Station</restaurant> bucks the trend. Not as much of a dive as others in Old Brooklyn, but not exactly a sports bar, or anything sophisticated.   The menu is relatively small and consists of the typical bar foods [burger, 2 salads, less than 4 or 5 sandwiches] but they were done well. My comrade was pleasantly surprised about the <dish>House Salad</dish>, it contained fresh greens, more than just the typical iceberg lettuce. The <dish>wings</dish>, a dozen for $6.50, were meaty and crispy.   Set in the middle of the space, the bar is a square with flat screen screen tvs placed above the bar on each side. On the maroon walls, there's some fire station memorabilia, but not overbearing like most other places that have any memorablia on its walls. It's relatively freshly painted and not dirty or sticky. I didn't ask for their full beer selection, but there were a host of domestic bottles, and <dish>Dundee Festive Ale</dish> on tap, 22oz for $3, a good deal. Two dundees, a domestic, house salad, dozen wings, and a buffalo chicken wrap for around $25.   The place was dead on my only visit with a small group of some younger regulars on another side of the bar. The owner asked us to put on whatever we wanted on the TV.   There's also a Golden Tee Machine and arcade bowling [the version where you use buttons and a ball built-in to the machine to bowl on a video screen].    <dish>Memphis Station</dish> isn't noteworthy but deserves a visit if you're looking for a cheaper bar with food in Old Brooklyn. I'd go again and personally prefer it to Dina's. A very high 3 stars.",1

I mentioned that I would be paying for this on my own so he offered me a student rate as well. I have many family and friends who are with other agencies and often feel decieved.

Finding a vet that you're comfortable with and can trust is no easy task, but I definitely found it at South Mountain Vet.    Dr. Beyer has always been helpful, friendly and positive when checking up on my dog, even when she's being fussy and a brat.  Her insight has always been a breathe of fresh air even in the hardest of circumstances.  The staff there has always been friendly and willing to work with my schedule as best as they could.  Not to mention, they are great at sending reminders when vaccinations or any other tests are needed or past due.    I'm so glad I found this place almost 5 years ago now and won't go anywhere else as long as I'm in the Valley."
q6Xf-u2wFpXJYcCal9hqGA,"With anger over Verizon pricing, I started looking at T-Mobile to swap my cell phone plan. However, given a cell phone store/branch can yield widely different results/experiences, I turned to Yelp to see which one was best.   Wow, what a positive experience! This review only adds to the great reviews already posted for this store.   I went in on Wednesday around 1 PM and was immediately greeted by 3 employees (forgive me, their names escape me). Being a Verizon customer (at the time), I had many questions regarding T-Mobile's plans, pricing, etc. Everyone was polite and answered all my questions.   After about 15 minutes, I mentioned I would take some time to think about it and perhaps come back the next day. NO pressure from the employees. It is evident that they want you to be a happy customer, even if that means not switching carriers.  Well, I spent all of 3 hours and went back to the store that evening around 6:30 PM to switch to their plans. It was busy when I went back, but the same employees were there. They worked with their other customers and I was helped around 7 PM. At this point, the store manager Cassandra was there to answer any additional questions I had.  I swapped all my lines over and, seeing the clock was pushing 8 PM (closing time), I mentioned that I could set my phone up at home. The employee working with me immediately said he had no problem staying late to make sure everything was working great. Now that's customer service!   Everything was seamlessly swapped over -- I am pleased with T-Mobile thus far -- and further pleased with this location. Do not hesitate to work with this branch. The manager Cassandra and her team will ensure that you will have a pleasant/positive experience!"

S4Gb3V7p5piEqRaP8dk1oA,"I recently relocated from Los Angeles and a new friend of ours invited us out to see him perform at the Charlotte Comedy Theatre.  I wasn't expecting much, after all it was a free comedy show, in an obscure location (the back hallway of the Graduate on the corner of Plaza and Central) and I am used to \Hollywood -caliber\"" improv shows, like those at the Groundlings on Melrose Ave.  We grabbed a bucket of beer and headed down the hallway that said \""Restrooms,\"" then into the tiny theater with makeshift seating and a simple stage.  I started fast on my beers, a strategy intended for enduring what I anticipated would be a lukewarm performance.  Much to my surprise, the Charlotte Comedy Theatre was a breath of fresh air, a sign that Charlotte has more than a pulse, it has a soul.  And I mean this with no disrespect, but as a growing city, looking to be more cosmopolitan than southern, Charlotte needs more culture and more entertainment; Charlotte Comedy Theater serves up both.  A friendly MC warmed up the crowd and they started with a Du-rap-rap, improv rap sequence, with the entire cast, who took turns rapping a comedic rhyme based on a name with a single syllable.  As cheesy as this may sound, it was quite enjoyable and funny.  The rest of the evening, different pairs of cast members did a variety of improv exercises, involving suggestions from the audience (which unsurprisingly veered toward the R-rated).  There were moments of brilliance, hilarity and sometimes even genius.    What stood out to me was the raw joy that each performer had in what they delivered.  Absent was the smug conceit and what we saw was a a special combination of talent, chemistry and spontaneity.   The cast as a whole was pretty good, but there were a handful of standout performers, which I will attempt to remember.    JAMES (a bald, black guy): Wickedly funny; he gets lost into the characters and is a thrill to watch.  MIKE (a guy with brown hair and glasses): Sharp, left field in his improv style, with the kind of humor of a \""still waters run deep\"" sort of way. ANDY (bald white guy): His best moments were during physical comedy situations (the ostrich farm and kung fu sequence). A YOUNG NEWCOMER, male, lean, curly hair: this one showed real potential, unassuming in appearance and stage presence, he sneaks up on you with some deadly funny lines.  You must check this crew out. So far, this has proven to be the best thing I've discovered in Charlotte.  For $10, you can't beat it."""

-xF5YR1_ok69eJdY0XSolg,"We have been living here for almost a year and what I like about Strayhorse is it is really quite here. I think a lot of that is because it is a small complex. The staff is great and always friendly. Whenever I put in a service request they are usually here that same day to fix the problem. They are pet friendly which is great, but there are a few knuckleheads that don't pick up after their dogs. Hey if you have a dog it's your responsibility to pick up after them, people. Unfortunately, the few always ruin it for the majority. But the cool thing is that the service guy always goes around first thing in the morning to pick up after those inconsiderate ones. I would recommend this complex."
9MbGG8PxrlpBWVm3QyWy_g,"If I could do zero stars I would.. I agree with Sasha 100%. I just finished with the painful reconstruction of my breasts damaged horribly by sacs..  He did two BA's on me. 2 mistakes I wish I never had done. My breasts were so badly damaged by sacs I had to have the implants removed.   Sacs also did lipo near my armpits severing a piece of my left pectoral muscle almost completely off and he left it dangling in my body!   sacs and I agreed to go over the muscle, or should I say he convinced me with fancy drawings and large medical vocabulary to go that route. Big mistake. You cannot see the implant when it's over the muscle in a mammogram which makes it more difficult to detect abnormalities. A vital piece of information he left out of our conversation.   When my explant was performed by a board certified plastic surgeon she stated one implant was under the muscle and one was over! Really?, I sure did not agree to that lazy way of performing the surgery. It caused me to now have scarring under and over the muscle , costing more money, more time and more pain to have repaired.   Thank god my wonderful Board Certified  Plastic Surgeon found it and repaired it, along with repairing all the other damage caused by sacs.  Sacs just wants your money, disregarding your health and safety.   Please spend the extra money on an actual plastic surgeon. Sacs will damage your body and not give it a second thought."

LAME.  I wasn't going to be fussy and have a tantrum like a little kid, so I caved and let them bring me food from here. I can guarantee that I ate it like a two year old kid. I picked at it, played with it, complained about it, and if I could have, I would have fed it to a dog. However, I view that as animal cruelty.  I give them kudos for attempting to be festive and mix the grease with leafy greens, but it still comes down to that nasty grease they fry everything in.  That's all my tongue sensed. I hated the food and then myself later that night as I made many trips to the bathroom, cursing each time.   Remember, beggars can't be chooser.

a9Q9QKf-iomkr7Ctp4Puhg,"I am not a candy eater, but my wife is a chocoholic freak so I go here a lot with her or for her.  I was just there this morning to pick up more candy for her since she was running out.  I just thought I would mention the fact that they are always very courteous at See's and they do something very carefully that I most other establishments don't.  When you buy some candy, they have various box sizes -- half pound, one pound, two pound, etc. etc.  When they put your box on the scale when you are paying for your candies, the scale automatically adjusts for the weight of the box, whether it be the small half pound box, or a big five pound box.  You might not think that this is a big deal, but some places don't do this or the adjustment is not very accurate.  Also, I was using a gift certificate for one pound of candy so they filled the one pound box full -- when they weighed it, the weight was not quite one pound so they gave me the two extra pieces in a small bag.  Most places just fill the box and call it even.  So I think that See's concern for customer service and giving the customer full value for their dollar is very good, especially in today's \bad customer service climate\"".  Incidentally, my wife says that the value to price ratio of See's candy is even higher than Godiva Chocolates, Bill Blase chocolates, etc. etc.  She should know -- consuming maybe 50 pounds of choc candy each year!!"""
fayxTgKXseTEfLba6dG5xg,I had a very bad experience with this company. They did not wrap any of the furniture in the blankets or plastic that was left unused in the truck. They put multiple major gouges in the walls when moving items upstairs. The movers were complete amateurs compared to the moving company we used last year (should have kept their number). One mover was using chewing tobacco and spitting in a clear plastic bottle the entire time. They were nice enough guys but didn't care about our things and were not well trained.   They said a confirmation email on the quote was sent but we did not receive it. The total cost was $260 more than we were expecting to pay. It was our mistake not  confirming the final estimated cost before the move in date so make sure you don't make the same mistake if you decide to use these movers. I will never use them again.

dEMxDUhYqXmaUQomVCTA-A,Great area for a walk or a run.  Very clean but was somewhat worried that no one else was on the path.  It appeared safe and was very close to my hotel.  You will have plenty of plane noise with it being close to the airport.
Y0oYyQdVa7v-K5fDYK5EiQ,"I was looking for a housekeeper and found this company here on Yelp! They have excellent reviews for a reason. I booked my appointment, and 2 very nice people showed up to clean my huge apartment. They bring their own supplies. The price is very reasonable, and the place was sparkling when they left. I was stunned that they cleaned a 4 bd 2 bath 2 story apartment in 3 hours. I believe it's cash only. I will be using them every month from now on."
6iKh5WrcNO3UBprCJy-22A,My patio cover looks great! The price was very reasonable. I could not be happier with the patio. The communication regarding the schedule could have been a little better though.  We had to keep the dogs inside because we weren't sure exactly when they were coming. The job was completed quickly and it looks great.
R8q3AxiQOiPmDqDU1A0UTA,"I'm a big fan of dive bars and <restaurant>Lucky Joe's</restaurant> definitely fits the bill. It's on the smaller side, always way too dark, almost always feels kind of empty, and the bartenders are always friendly. Plus, there's pool, video poker of course, and a snack machine featuring half chips and half cigarettes. Sure, this isn't a place to go out of your way for to grab a drink at, but it's a great neighborhood hangout. And the beer selection is decent.",1
UBEUfivF3-Y1mw0YLKx86g,"I love L'occattaine Cherry Blossom perfume!! It is my favorite perfume! I try to always buy a bottle when we are in Vegas, because I love trying all their in store samples. But I'm not against buying it online either. Normally my hubby and kids keep me with enough stock from Christmas and Birthday gifts that I don't have to buy it often. The Cherry Blossom Shimmering Lotion is amazing too! It helps layer the scent, but it feels so luxurious on me and it has little shimmers in it so when the light catches it, it looks like my legs are sparkly. I love it!!"
35wqG7WhJbyO8ow_JCJnUA,"I've always been a fan of Boyd and Blair vodka and I knew they were local, but I had no idea HOW local. Went today for a tour, which was quick but very informative. I love that they have a mini bar set up with interesting cocktails that taste absolutely wonderful. I also love that everything about the place is manual and run by 6 people. It really truly is HAND-CRAFTED vodka.  I also learned that they have classes where they are teaching cocktail making techniques, and I definitely plan to take one. I need to hone my mixology skills and they're ready to help.  It was a lovely afternoon and I will take others there for tours and tastings. I look forward to future visits."
tZxHLYXLNqnlht4ToW_qBA,"This is the second year Cabarrus Charter Academy upper school has been open and they've had their share of issues but with any new school there are things that need to be worked out in order for the school to reach optimal performance!    There are some great teachers here and there were some who should have been closely evaluated before ever receiving a teaching license!   We can see the positive changes that were instituted over the summer, so we are back to give it another chance!"
b3DU73XjPWC9A1ZdD4I75A,"Sad.... I have been buying my scrubs here for the past few years and always enjoyed coming in, the staff is friendly and polite easy to talk to and always willing to help. My whole family buys our scrubs here! I'm sad to say that none of us will return....   I went in and bought some scrubs and one of the styles I wanted they didn't have my size. So the female who worked there overly assured me that they run small and shrink and that I will be fine especially once I washed them. I tried them On and she was right they did run small. A few days later after I washed them I wore them to work and as they started to loosen up and they chafed the inside of my legs so bad that I was raw and bled. When I took them back to the store I was honest to the girl told her what I was informed about, and that I had washed them and wore them. She would NOT damage them out! She told me it was not a manufacturer defect and that bc I wore them and washed them the answer was no, but I could get another pair with a 20% discount. I usually get 10% already with my hospital discount. Then she preceded to check the lining inside for a \defect\"" which she didn't see. I offered to show her my legs which she said no. The worst part of the whole experience was the girl that sold them to me stood there and didn't say one word, never stepped in or anything..... Maybe she should have encouraged the manager to help me out like she encouraged me to buy them...... I will never go back.!"""
1VAsBosvx02jpvIUxiKvmg,"We had passed by this small little shop a few times but had never tried it until today.  This is a frozen-food establishment, serving hot meals a couple of days a week (a few tables to sit at to eat).  Exceptional variety of <dish>frozen dumplings</dish> and <dish>Chinese bau</dish>.  We purchased <dish>onion pancakes</dish> (frozen with sheets separating them for convenience which is always a good thing) as well as <dish>pork and leeks dumplings</dish>.  VERY yummy.  The variety is there and a lot tastier than the usual frozen dumpling offerings at grocery store chains.  A nice option to have in the freezer for quick meals (convenience).",1

RcSw5QAzBCGTcPDT4SD4jw,"I was on the hunt for a new work bag so I started calling  different local stores to inquire about the handbags they had in their inventory.  Disappointed by the selection in my area I called, randomly, 5 hours away to one of the Céline boutiques in Las Vegas.    Nicole was great!  She offered to text me pictures of the bags in stock.  She sent me multiple styles and colors and was always quick to respond when I had questions.  It took me a couple of days to decide on THE one.  All through the selection process I never felt pressured or rushed.  I had such a great experience shopping with Céline even before I ever set foot in their store.  I was amazed at how quickly my purchase arrived.  I ordered the handbag on a Tuesday and was carrying it on my arm by Thursday.  On a recent trip to Vegas I made it a point to visit the Céline store at Crystals.  All of the staff was very friendly and helpful as I tried on their jewelry.  Highly recommended!"
lPJ4zGE8EEGZcvZDxgtipg,"Two years ago we purchased a home thru Blandford in the Mulberry community.   We are so very happy that we decided to invest in this community.   We love it here!   We have had a great experience from our initial visit up till today.   They have been professional and up front.  I really loved how they were accommodating to some of my wishes.   No sale goes without a hiccup of some sort.   However, how a company makes it right is what I look for.  They were spot on with their correspondence.  They quickly corrected the situation.  If we ever sell this house we will look for another Blandford hone for sure.   Thank you for such a great experience!  Buy with confidence.  PS- go see Ernie at Mulberry.  You will not find a better sales person.  He is simply the best around!"
Zu0t3NhDQ6svY35AZjLxeA,"Booster juice is great. I like the options and the taste of their product. This location could use a little face lift, from getting friendlier staff and keeping up the appearance, as it looks a little messy/ dirty the last few times I've visited. Other then that it's a good place a little over priced but that's not this location, it's the actual company to blame"

Zurx3BplOp3C0_UM3_HxwA,"They have a cool free rides promotion - you get a free ride if you use a code from a friend  mine is offerr1ue  - feel free to use it (we'll both benefit)!  Uber is great when there's enough available cars in your area. However - that usually overlaps with high availability of cabs. I like their price estimates - it's good to know in advance! It's also easy not to worry about payment since it's charged to your credit card directly. Some say it's not as safe as cabs - but with the Uber rating system I feel very safe to ride with a driver that has good ratings. It's also good for people that leave their stuff behind in the car (easy to get in touch with the driver and retrieve the lost items) - but it never happened to me. We usually take an Uber X, but once we were moving some stuff and got an Uber XL. Whenever I take it I am happy with the service. There are a few downsides too - the Uber navigation software that the drivers use doesn't always take you from the best route. The waiting time estimate can be misleading - and it often takes more time than initially estimated. Sometimes you count on getting an Uber and there aren't cars available, or they hike the prices - to an even higher price compared to a cab. It happened to me when I was counting on an Uber to go to the airport late at night (or early in the morning) and I ended up hailing a cab after walking in the rain to a main street and waiting for a few minutes.  In a nutshell - it's my default option - but you can not rely on just Uber in Montreal."

yvmYYSO_z6C5abERv6zjIQ,I got my hair done and I am not really a hair person so it was good the stylist knew about how to take care of my hair. Everyone was really nice and my stylist Shalonda was very good. If I had to promote anyone it's her. She knew that my hair had damage based on looking at it. I got damage a couple months back from braids and lost a big chunk of my hair in the middle of my head. I told her I'm simple and she designed a hair style even I could take care of. I had a great experience and would definitely go back.
v0cl_1amwGypwFIS9-w8zw,"Agree with the other Yelpers here... this is a small, under-stocked, over-priced grocery store. I understood why people shopped here a year ago, but now that the new Maple Quay Longo's has opened, WHY oh WHY would anyone still go here?  I'll tell you: I'm lazy too. I work at Harbourfront Centre, so this is a go-to place when I only have 5 minutes to go and grab something to stuff in my face.  It's always crowded too... a strange mix of wandering office people and poor old ladies trying to navigate their carts in the tiny aisles who don't know any better.  That said, I usually try to take an extra minute and run to RABBA instead... prices are way better there. Can you believe that??? A convenience store is cheaper than this Sobeys. Disgusting!  And if you're up for a bit of a longer walk, go to Whole Foods a little further east on Queens Quay, or walk all the way to Lower Jarvis to the massive Loblaws.  I hate that sometimes shopping here just can't be avoided... well, I guess it could, but I'm too lazy to ALWAYS remember my lunch. Darn."
1KJCoOt2bc0799wmUsgLcw,"I'll preface this by admitting it was my first time in a laundromat.  Pros: THEY OFFER RECYCLING, fairly clean, public restrooms, multiple areas to sit and lounge, multiple areas to stand and sort/fold clothes, coin changer, radio, outlets, good location  Cons: no ATM, no wifi. I came around 1pm on a Monday and there was a small wait (10-15 mins) to use a dryer. I thought the pricing was a bit high (2.25 for cheapest washer, 0.25 for 7 mins of drying).  I would probably come here again when I have multiple loads; I did save time."

eQS4GqUh-D4Si-ERVa5IQw,"I am a sucker for these types of stores even more (I guess I am entering that phase of my life).  So when they were having a 15% off Memorial Day weekend sale, of course we could not help but go and see what we can find for the house.    We were quite excited to find that we could get the Kitchenaid Mixer that we had wanted and save a nice chunk of change on it.  What would have normally cost us about $450 soon became slightly more justifiable at $390.  They actually had the item in stock which was better too so we would not have to wait. The staff is always pretty friendly here, and they always have neat stuff that matches our tastes.   Given the location of the store (not too far from the city where we live), our history of good experiences, and the fact that we have never had a problem or bad experience here, we will definitely be back and recommend this location for all of your home furnishing needs."

TrVKJkWWQeMTK_ly0PMGtg,"Okay.. this is my favorite Korean food delivery place in LA. And I was so surprised that this place opened in Las Vegas which I am so happy!! This is the place to go if you love spicy food. Usually, I go to BWW and get the Blazing which it's the last HOT level! and This place has some spicy food level 1 - 7. I can maybe eat 4? that's how spicy they make food here. If you want to challenge yourself, go for it! Lol That's what I did. I ordered 7  at first and I could not even continue eating after one or two bite. But Spicy foods are so good!!! I like my food in level 3-4 now. lol Price wise.. I can say it might sounds pricey but portion wise.. I am good with it.  I highly recommended to try their food from HOT & SPICY menu, if you like spicy food. This is the place to go!"

EWJqdMlvrIq5FAUD8UGDvA,"If you are looking for a QUICK Chinese buffet, then check out ZEN. If you are expecting fancy, gourmet Chinese food, then go to <restaurant>PF Changs</restaurant>.  They transformed the former Bill Johnson's building into a lovely nine-station Chinese Buffet restaurant with SUPER friendly service. The staff (and customers I kept bumping into) were all very nice and cordial.  The food is not authentic Chinese...I would say more American-Chinese tasting. Zen is your typical, average Chinese buffet place.    There is a variety of the more popular Chinese dishes, a dessert station, all fruit station, sushi station, and soups, etc... There are MANY fried foods too.  I'm very leery about eating at Buffets (esp Chinese Buffets). It was pretty busy during a weekday lunch hour and the foods were at their proper temperatures. Clean restroom (a good sign).",1
ed2dbeBW4SvjCbW617x0wQ,"The service I experienced was absolutely terrible, and I can say that it was the worst.  I booked my room over a month ago, discussed with whomever I was speaking to that I had a Service Dog on the phone. They of course said that this was fine. (Refusing a service dog is illegal).  Well when I arrived at the front desk I was told to \get that filthy animal out of the hotel\"". My dog is not a pet, he is a SERVICE DOG. And he is medical equipment. I was told to leave by many employees, and had nowhere to stay. I had to sleep in my car."""

This last grooming I noticed my cat was kind of down for a few days after, then rubbing on her back there are bumps all over it.  The times the grooming was sloppy or something odd happened is when Alicia herself does the grooming.  Her groomers that work for her actually do a better job.  Each time I did not like the grooming was when she did it and this last time confirmed that. I'm giving stars for her groomers that did a good job, not Alicia herself."

The surrounding area is not the best but the apartment grounds are quiet, pretty, and very well kept.  Pam and Carl were both very helpful and any request I had was dealt with quickly and professionally.  The floor plan of the apartments is really nice, with two master suites and I loved my balcony. The area was quiet too (I heard noise one time, on a Saturday night - so no big deal).  I would live there again."
hyYm9Tb8HPpFSSLZzI6pqg,"I love this Pure Barre studio. Sure, it's expensive and yes, the work outs can get a little repetitive, but if you switch it up by attending classes with different teachers then you'll be golden.   This is really an all-female studio (sorry, guys) with clientele dressed to the nines in their Lulu outfits. Maybe it's a little yuppie, but at least everyone there is serious about getting a good workout in. You wouldn't pay the fees here if you just want to socialize. You'll see results in a few weeks - my arms and back have never looked this toned. There are a variety of class times (6 am to 6:30 pm) during the week and on the weekends, so you can definitely fit PB into your schedule. My membership recently expired but I'll buck up soon and swipe that credit card - this workout is too good to pass up."

After being seated at our table, and started placing orders.  I was placing an order of Risotto.  The server was apologetic, told us that the kitchen ran out of risotto.  We had ended up ordering this <dish>Amelfi Nera</dish>, few starters and few main courses.  We also wanted to order something for the kid.  The server was so nice, suggested a <dish>white sauce spaghetti</dish> for the kid so we ordered.  Unfortunately it slid downhill from there.  Bread  would have taken a couple second to serve, and keep us occupied for a bit.  However, the server came and apologized again and told us the restaurant ran out of bread.  We literally waited 15mins for the food to come.  As much of English-speaking resto should the appetizer served before the main course of a meal; surprisingly, the main course came first.  Also, they missed the order of the kid's meal.  I have never seen such disorganized restaurant. Sorry to say, first impression are shown to be very hard to change.  I had a bad experience with this restaurant.  I will not come again.",1

bI4emjU96ZvGQRTwxItd2w,"Interesting mix of Thai and other Asian foods. This is the first Thai restaurant I have been to that serves <dish>sweet and sour chicken</dish>! Menu is good with a good selection of soup, noodle dishes, wok dishes, and rice dishes.  I got the <dish>Pad Thai with shrimp</dish>. Asked for medium spiciness, and it was completely without spice. I asked them to bring me the sweet chili sauce, which made a big difference. Even with that, it was not spicy enough. Maybe they spice it for Americans who don't like Thai food. I food was pretty good. There was something sticky on the noodles that I'm not used to, but it was okay. Pretty good amount of shrimp too.  Small beer selection, but adequate. Prices are okay. You pick how you want the food prepared (wok , Over rice, or noodles) and then the price is based on the type of meat. $10 for chicken, Pork, etc., Up to $15 for more expensive meat.  Service was excellent. Very friendly staff. Food was prepared very quickly.  Would have given higher marks, but the food really was not great.",1

ujqstpIHNfZfl4NAGukRCA,"Rory R. I brought my dog in for a groom only.  The groomer was very nice and accomodating, however if are asking me to rate the actual grooming then i honestly have to say it was a very amateur job. My dog's coat was very uneven, and pretty much butchered. Also after two weeks or so, he kept scrtching his ears, so I took a tweezers  and plucked out the fur from his ears, which is usually a standard procedure when he goes to other groomers. His ears were not cleaned at all and I pulled out lots of fur. i also paid the most i have ever paid any other groomer."

It was definitely cool to try NC wines, but they, like this bar, were just okay. The server was pretty unfriendly and didn't seem at all passionate about what he was doing. He wouldn't make recommendations because he said that everyone's taste is difference, yada, yada, yada. But I think that's a cop out. All he had to ask was, what do you like, and then he should be able to point folks in the right direction."

On EVERY occasion, they have been the most respectful and professional folks to deal with. They have raised the bar and really set themselves apart in the automotive service industry. As much as this review is for congratulating them for a continuous, \Job well done\"", it's just as much an important review for all future customers who are in need of help with their vehicle. Clearly today's world is about checking reviews for the best value and customer service. So from one consumer to another, I'm here to put my neck on the line so to say, and publicly tell you that trusting your vehicle to them would be the best decision you could make. It's their hearts desire to genuinely serve others. To the core they have ALWAYS done the right thing from the start, and have our best interests at heart. Thank you, -C. Hansen"""

I have bought a used tower here and it is still going strong.  I've also bought some memory, software and other smaller things.  The staff has always been really helpful and never tried to sell me something I did not actually need.  In fact, one of the guys, forget his name, is also a photographer.  It really helps when the staff can speak the same language and has the same concerns.    I'm looking forward to a visit in 2014 when it is time to upgrade my tower to a newer (used) model.

She has a 'succulent bar' set up where you can choose from a sweet assortment of pots, choose a baby succulent and have it potted right there in the shop.

BVECOSGZ00AYzrg2gimbJw,I love Davidson. I grew up within 20 miles of Davidson and I live here now. It's a great community but too much traffic because of I-77. the pedestrian areas are dangerous these days. We need more police on bikes and in town to control the traffic and pedestrians that do not use the crosswalks downtown. It's crazy!
y6HUE8dzHU-PWZ1mkVfSnA,"This place has made a decent attempt to offer some very different burger experience.  The bun is unlike any other place. The range of toppings is great too. As you give your order, a verbal cue to the cook is given who starts working on it right away.   My server was courteous and knowledgable. Clean space and fresh food with a very different approach.  I love this place. Probably the BEST burger I have had in a very very long time.",1

ptZKX4YYmh_F69Vt2R_tkw,"Avoid Empire Today. Use someone else. Even if it costs a little (or a lot) more. Don't trust their sales agents and just avoid.  My number 1 concern when talking to the sales agent was not wanting carpet that looks crushed, matted, worn, etc., in areas of high use. The salesman assured me that the carpet he is recommending will not do that - in fact, if it did past a certain measurement then it can be replaced per warranty. 6 months after installation of normal use, part of the carpet looks terrible. I had it professionally cleaned and the cleaner thought it was 5 years old - not 6 months. I called EmpIre Today and their inspection process took 3+ months. Then I was told it's a \high traffic area\"" and not covered by warranty. Really? So the salesman clearly lied about the warranty and the product to induce purchase. Clearly a fraudulent act. The product is clearly flawed."""

_S7JiuIis5UsUF1RoqHG4g,Loved this. I hadn't done portraits since my mom made me get my pictures done at Olen Mills when I was a child.   Hatton Photography had a booth at the Boxer Luv Rescue 5k and was holding a drawing for a photo shoot and I won! This was perfect for me because one of my dogs had just died a month prior and I was feeling the need to do something special with my other 2.   Jennifer was very patient with me and my dogs - even when I was getting frustrated that they weren't holding a pose lol. She knew all the tricks. Just picked up the portraits and they were flawless! Jennifer made this so easy and she is very talented. I would recommend this to all pet parents!
saYqzd_shsong4ALy-M8Aw,"This was convenient to my home and I was desperate.  I think its quite deceptive that they keep raising their rates every few months.  Don't assume that your monthly rental will be what they advertised on the website.  I made that mistake.  I assumed that it would be a yearly lease, my mistake.  Also they make you buy their lock for ~$20.  Super annoying, I was expecting to pay a lot less, now I am paying about 30% more than I was originally quoted.  TOTALLY DECEPTIVE!   Ask when their rates will go up and how soon that will affect you.  With no rate guarantee, I would not advise any storage unit.  I am looking to leave quick.  Lord help me liquidate."

mruax-1iDdb8GlAKwLy8JQ,"Totally sufficient for a day/overnight stay.  I had a 10 hour layover (yikes) into CPH (Copenhagen)  here and got a great day rate until 6pm, more than enough time.  I just wanted to nap, do work, shower and head back to the airport and total experience was fine.    Shuttle back to the airport not an issue, service not an issue.  It's a typical Hotel Indigo and for the rate and responsiveness of staff, Am fine with it.  Visits:  1  Tip:  This is a good if not great alternative to sitting at the airport for 10 hours if you want a bed and real shower.  Always ask for the quietest room when you stay by any airport, they have those.   This hotel is a few miles from the airport.   I got a quiet room and slept great!!!    The day rate is negotiated when you call in.  Be aware though whenever you bid a Priceline discount room, you will get the worst room in the hotel:  it is what it is."

40Uv2fqNecbqk0ruo7DIDA,"Not bad at all.  I have been to them twice. Once for a perceived muffler problem. Turns out it was some gasket and they just rigged it up to stop the noise and charged 50$. That fix has held for the past 7 months. They could have just said \yep, it's the muffler\"" and charged 130$  The other time it was for a throttle position sensor and it was much less than the dealer quote.   They also allowed me to same day reschedule quickly to meet a change.  They're definitely light on the social skills... but who really gives a damn?  I'm a fan so far  EDIT 09/20/2010 My truck was making a weird noise for a couple of days, on the third day it stopped making the noise but I took it anyways to see what might be up. They drove it around and looked at some things but could not find anything. The charge? 0$.... very cool"""

cd-c24cIdmOm98Y9zkjBIA,"Dawn and the staff at Stanford Capital are awesome!  They were very helpful and knowledgeable.  they make things very clear about what they need from you and if you don't have it they go out of their way to help you get it.  I misplaced my Note - I'm sure it's somewhere in my paperwork but wow they went out of their way to help me obtain it so I didn't have to tear the house apart and hold up my refinancing - it could have taken me weeks to find it or I may not have ever found it but they knew how and got it in just a couple days.  They saved me so much time and I appreciate that!  I know the mortgage business can be a busy one and I myself have a hard time trusting people.  Well I guarantee that if you utilize Stanford Capital you will NOT be disappointed.  Just know you the consumer has to help get things done you have to participate as they will require items, signatures, etc.  The staff can only do so much and if you don't return their call or participate in your refinance you will find it difficult only because y ou make it difficult!  So TRUST  the Staff and Dawn will make a difficult transaction as easy as possible - just participate and it will be done in no time.  Dawn, Tyler, Adriana - Thank you for all your hard work.  You made my refinance a BREEZE  and you helped me save a lot of money.  You Guys ROCK!"
1BWGgA_omh3i4zeXX5sqkA,"I just want everyone to know: Central Phoenix, a city of 1.5 million people, has exactly three private plant sellers: Whitfill Nurseries, SummerWinds Nurseries and Moon Valley Nurseries.     So support this place before all you have left is Home Depot.   After the Baker's closing, I had to find myself a new nursery. I can't tell you how sad that made me. I refuse to buy plants from big box stores.  I've been to Summerwinds twice now, and each time a lovely woman has been so friendly and helpful. I am new to this whole plant thing and mainly stay in the hard to kill zone, but I have no problem finding answers to all my newbie questions here. The staff is even willing to indulge me and look at pictures on my phone of my sad rubber plant with one straggling leaf.   Although Summerwinds doesn't have the same feeling the Baker's grounds had (because Baker's was a legitimate oasis in the desert), it does have the best pottery section. Their glazed ceramic pots are beautiful and everything is incredibly organized.   Bottom line, it's so easy to find what you need, just go already. Oh, and if you're lazy, they will even pot your plants for you. You don't even have to get your hands dirty."

The restaurant is spacious with a modern decor, and there is a private room at the back which is great for parties and events  For our visit, we had: <dish>Caprese</dish> - The bocconcini di bufala was amazing, as was the vine riped tomatoes  <dish>Carpaccio Di Manzo</dish> - great starter as well. My companion doesn't usually eat anything raw but she liked this!  <dish>Bosco Pizza</dish> (mozzarella, pancetta, cremini mushrooms, truffle oil and parsley) - simply delicious and I loved the fact that it's densely packed with toppings. The crust on the pizza was amazing!  <dish>Pappardelle alla Boscaiola</dish> (egg noodles with wild mushrooms and lamb ragu) - great meat sauce on this one, and the pasta was cooked perfectly  <dish>Scialateilli allo stile Amalfitana</dish> - a nice seafood pasta with a pasta that is unique to the Amalfi coast (nice chew and thickness to it!)   <dish>Gnocchi Verde</dish> - Spinach based gnocchi with gongozola cream and pistacchio. Absolutely deliciocus! I would say this is a must get!  <dish>Scottadito alla romana</dish> - Lamb chops that are presented nicely on a wooden board, with rapini, potatoes and fried onions. Great portion size on this one!  All the pasta and pizzas are made fresh in-house and I could really taste the difference. Service was friendly thoroughtout the night and at a pace that we didn't feel rushed.   Overall we really enjoyed our visit and would not hesitate to recommend this place for anyone looking to dine in the Thornhill area.",1
fqBPL9fln5FrFvAmH5sEdw,"I moved here from Tucson due to a job transfer from Tucson to Phoenix. It turned out to be a HUGE mistake! The apartment was in no way ready on move in day - there was no hot water, the washing machine was broken, the window screen was punched out, there was a metal frame with sharp edges in the bathroom with no doors attached to and a broken shower curtain bar just above it. The dryer duct was taped to the wall, i.e., there is no external dryer vent and this fire hazard was fixed ONLY when I filed a complaint with the City of Phoenix.  It was a struggle to communicate the urgency involved especially with the hot water. I figured as long as I have hot water and AC for the rest of the lease all would be well. But be advised - the neighborhood is questionable. There are dirty mops, bags of garbage in front of some of the residences and the dumpsters are constantly overflowing refuse all over. (!!!) The hallways are filthy and stink like a hundred demons. The fitness center was closed down and nobody in the front office has a clue as to when or if it will ever be available (I was forced to purchase a 6 month outside membership but had expected this to be provided as part of my rent as stated on their website.) this is a slum and there's no defending it - if you can afford better, avoid this dump. NOT RECOMMENDED!!! FYI: They are currently, fraudulently marketing this dump with amenities that are patently absent - a swimming pool that has been closed for the summer of 2016 for safety violations and arrears with City fines, a nonexistent fitness center, and a nonexistent resident center. The fitness center apparently caught fire from faulty wiring and has never existed from day 1 since I moved there.  It has recently been purchased by the new slumlords who are worse than the former ones if this is even fathomable. Maintenance is non-existent and the lower floors are crawling with roaches.  My AC has fortunately been functional however I understand that many residents do not have it.  Lease here at the risk of your sanity! FYI: The new scumlords removed all of the adverse reviews (which was 100% of them) from their website - seems they don't want the TRUTH to be revealed!"

The price for the combo is more then affordable and for the portion of food you get you can't go wrong. Some places give you big portions of alright food but this place gives you a top quality home made Caribbean dish. The service is good and quick. You'll always hit a line up but don't expect to wait longer then 10 minutes. Foods always fresh. I recommended the <dish>BBQ chicken combo</dish> or <dish>jerk chicken combo</dish> (5 bucks),1

52cOElVIgms1aTK7HY18XQ,"First, I would like to say that there are so many good reviews on this horrible complex because the management bribed their residents when they renewed their lease to write a good review for a visa gift card.  Since the Connor Group has taken over this complex, everything has gone down the drain and I am not even sure where to start.  First, their customer service is unacceptable.  Many people have complained about various issues and they give all of us different excuses if they even get back to us.  There have been many issues that have needed \special parts\"" and some of these parts including the AC parts are taking 2+ months.  I was promised new gym equipment, cabana style pool atmosphere, updated hallways and the list goes on.  The only thing I have gotten out of the Connor group has been no AC in the hallways (which I have complained about since 6/4/2016 and still to this day 7/27/2016, they are still waiting for a special part), not a clean pool, a trash bill that went up from $13 to $60, trash that is piled up in the parking garage (imagine the smell in the dead heat of summer), a sewer and water bill that keeps going up even though I haven't changed a thing.  I cannot wait to turn in my 60 days notice next renewal.  They did update my apartment at renewal and increased my rent $120.  They told me they would be putting in hardwood flooring.  I came home to the company doing the \""hard wood flooring\"" measuring the laminate wood like flooring in the parking lot and then doing a horrible installation job.  Yup, I got laminate floor that looks like hard wood all for $120 more a month.  They told me that wouldn't upgrade my appliances because that would cost me another $150 a month.  I also have neighbors that only got a $40 rate increase.  I have lived here for 6 years and that loyalty has counted for nothing.  With all the apartment complexes going up right now, I would NEVER recommend this complex to anyone!"""
0qk9V2K2xWgcCeiLGmU3Wg,"Cute little cafe where Serissa used to be. It's nice how there's floor to ceiling windows and it faces the park across the road so you get some nice natural lighting, especially when the weather is nice. If you want some nice lighting for photos, there's plenty of seating all around the cafe as 2 walls are basically windows.  Decor somewhat resembles a garden. There's lot of green decor as well as white chandeliers, which gives off a relaxing atmosphere. There's couches and chairs so you can lounge around or be on your computer for a while.  Drinks are nothing out of the ordinary but they do have promos often. Prices are also very fair. Tip: if you order takeout, prices will be discounted. I havent yet tried their food but they do have a small menu available.   This cafe is still relatively new so they're growing in many ways. Staff are friendly and courteous which is always nice.

Is that thing 50 years old ? Did someone decide to hide some rocks in that thing ? I get that the sofa bed will never be as comfy as the main bed but I went to sleep with a 24 year olds back and woke up with an 87 year olds back. OTHER THAN THAT (and our phones not working lol), the room was very nice. Spacious, we all had space to do our own thing. It's got a fridge and a microwave, a sink in the living area, whatever amenities we needed they provided. My favorite thing is every night they have happy hour from 5:30 - 7:30 !!! Who doesn't like free drinks ? It's 2 drinks per person at a time with a limited amount of choices but who's complaining when it's free ? Also the free breakfast in the morning is really great ! Fresh fruit, cereal, bacon, sausage, an omelette station, fresh juice, and more ! By far one of the tastiest breakfasts I've had at a hotel.

52cOElVIgms1aTK7HY18XQ,"I have lived here for four years and it recently changed management to The Connor Group.  It has gone completely downhill since then and I am counting down until my lease is up.  The office refuses to accept packages for us even though this is how it has always been done and the last management company had no problem doing this.  So the packages get left in the lobby where anyone walking by could take them, and they pile up.  Before The Connor Group took over, you would see housekeeping every day multiples times a day.  The elevator, halls, and lobby always smelled like it was just cleaned. Now I don't ever see them and the halls and lobby are always a mess.  I once noticed a piece of trash on the floor in the lobby and took note....it sat there for five days.  Dirt in the elevator will sit there for days.  The people in the office are extremely rude, condescending, and defensive and have zero customer service skills.  Instead of the customer is always right motto, they take the customer is always wrong approach.  I put in a service request and it took them three days to get to me.  With Bell they were at your place within the hour every time."

The folks at Money Mart were able to get me my money in less than 10 minutes, unlike Money Direct, whose agent literally disappeared from my presence after repeatedly asking her to return.  After an hour of waiting, I had enough and made a mad dash across the street to this location.  Good thing I did or else I would have probably spent the entire weekend stuck at that other store.

cHW-RqsFowqNh0WJ4en_pQ,"I've only ever dealt with one woman each time I go there, but she is fairly rude and doesn't know what she's talking about. I went in asking her what type of caffeine-free/herbal teas they had. She told me they had one, which was decaf earl grey.  First, decaf still has caffeine (just less than normal). So for her to offer decaf earl grey to me when I asked for caffeine free is totally wrong and any employee of a coffee shop should know this, I've worked at a good earth before and I know they have several herbal (caffeine free) teas, I just couldn't remember what any of them were. I asked again, and said \no no, sorry, I need caffeine-free.\"" And she goes \""Decaf earl grey is all we have\"". Finally I explain to her that decaf doesn't mean free of caffeine and ask if I can have a tea list. She throws a tea list at me and walks away. I then have to stand there for 5 minutes waiting to make my order because at this point it feels like she is purposely ignoring me. She finally walks past me and I say \""Can I please have the...\"" she cuts my off and yell to the customer who just walked in \""What can I get you!\"" and once again ignores me. I wasn't ever rude to her so I'm unsure why she got so offended when I asked for <dish>herbal tea</dish> lol.

kkaA2z1MVwRnZfM1fSYbzA,"I went in with a wide cut on my hand - used a razor blade to remove a bottle label and sliced my hand up. I knew immediately that I was going to need stitches.  The people at UMC were wonderful. Clara did the intake, and Nurse Nancy brought me into the room and got things set up. Dr. Taylor did the stitching, and Nurse Jojo assisted. All of them were simply terrific.  The place was clean and quiet, and although there was one TV going for those who wanted to watch, at least they didn't have them everywhere.  They're efficient, though being an urgent care facility, it takes a while. My situation wasn't terribly urgent - I needed stitches, but I wasn't really bleeding - and I was there for several hours. I'd brought a book, so all was well. I had to go back a week later, and the wait was much shorter. also, they remembered me, which was nice. I recommend this place if you need care. But as with all medical facilities, bring something to keep you occupied."
_ZS1ssWX-2aKtT08q5JjUg,"I give these guys 5 stars because they are super friendly, have a great selection of products, and really care about doing a good job. I purchased my outdoor sectional, area rug, and coffee table yesterday. The sofa and coffee table were delivered this morning as they were both in stock. I am still waiting on the area rug and custom toss pillows but am expecting them in about 2 weeks.  After checking out several local competitors, I found that All American had the best service and selection for my decorating style, which is a little more modern. Many of the competitors mostly had a lot of that \Tuscan\"" look that really doesn't suit my needs. Also, the prices at All American were very competitive. So, after doing my research, I went back to All American and I'm glad that I did."""
HP8mkVdLa9F4Amsp2thKhQ,"So my husband and I have had a long standing debate... who does the best burritos in town?  He has always been a <restaurant>Burrito Boyz</restaurant> fan, I however stood by Fat Bastards claiming they were the \one to beat\"" so we decided to do a good ol fashioned taste off.  We ordered the exact same thing at both Fat Bastards and <restaurant>Burrito Boyz</restaurant>.    Here is what we found:    ORDERING <restaurant>Burrito Boyz</restaurant>.  When calling to place the order we were greeted with a friendly voice to take our order.  Placing the order took only a minute or two, and were told to pick the <dish>burrito's</dish> up in about 10-15 minutes.  Super quick!   Fat Bastards.  When calling to place the order the chick on the phone seemed annoyed we were calling (I must add that I normally just walk in when ordering from Bastards) I was put on hold several times, just trying to place the order took me like 10 minutes....  We were told to pick up the burrito in about 15 minutes. NOT a good start.  PICKING UP THE ORDER <restaurant>Burrito Boyz</restaurant>.  Quick and painless! Fat Bastards.  Waited an additional 15 minutes because they were really really busy.  THE BURRITO <restaurant>Burrito Boyz</restaurant>.  The small is big as hell and had a ton of extra guac, just how I like it.  Spiciness was just right and the bean, cheese, veggies ratio was good.  All in all, very pleased.   And only $6 for a <dish>bean and cheese with extra guac</dish>.   Fat Bastards.  The Reg was smaller than a burrito boyz small, spiciness was great (I love a spicy burrito) I asked for extra guac and paid $1.00 for nothing because no extra guac was given.  Ratio was good, just wish they weren't being so chincy on the toppings.  Paid $10 for bean and cheese with extra guac.    THE VIRDICT Sadly... my long time fav (Fat Bastards) was quickly knocked down and beaten to a pulp by the Boyz.  After doing a side by side comparison and taste test <restaurant>Burrito Boyz</restaurant> wins in every aspect.  The service, quantity, quality and price were easily handed to the Boyz.  The only thing that might have me going back to Fat Bastards is the deep fried creations... not the burritos.  Ever since our test we are now regulars at <restaurant>Burrito Boyz</restaurant> and they even know us by name  and I'm not ashamed!!! hahaha  <restaurant>BURRITO BOYZ</restaurant> FOR THE WIN!""",1
CNCTGLwM8L4eNp7x0z9XFw,"I enjoyed eating here. The atmosphere was very classy! We had the <dish>spinach dip appetizer</dish>. It tasted different but in a good way, it was more creamy and came with lots of <dish>toasted breadsticks coated in olive oil</dish> which were delicious! I enjoyed the <dish>Jamaican jerk chicken</dish>! The chicken breast was very juicy and flavorful! I took one star off because I didn't really enjoy my side dishes! The <dish>rice</dish> was bland!

WMbaBGpWX2rROed0q-R5EA,"As a pool owner, I am constantly spending money and driving around instead of floating in the pool with a drink (umbrella in the drink optional).  If I have to go buy something for the pool, this is the place to go.    First, they are right around the corner from my house, so it's easy to pop in and pick up what I need.  Secondly, their prices are always lower than the other pool supply chains.    On top of the low prices and location, their staff is always top notch.  They look for ways to save you money, and are always willing to order a part or help you find what you need.  The only less than perfect expedience I had was when I drained my pool - I rented a pump from therm, and the hose kept splitting and tearing, and it was missing one of the clamps.  I called right away to make sure I wasn't charged for the damage, but when I returned it, I only got a half-hearted sorry.  No real apology for the equipment failure.  I didn't even want a refund of part of the money, although I would have taken it.  So that and the fact that their hours are from 10 am to 6:30 pm making it hard to go in on days I work late, are the only 2 things holding back the last star.  If you rent equipment, make them check it first and you should have an awesome experience!"

Brgw8CWtNL6JxzTFxI0c7A,In a cafe the tables really mean a lot to me. In fact a cafe with a table I love gets four stars just for the table. This cafe had my all time favorite table so far in all my cafe adventures. I just loved it. This big round white table. We even got to sit around it with the owners themselves who treated us beautifully.  Do you think that your experience in a place is partly BECAUSE of the place? I mean I really enjoyed the people I was visiting with and our conversation was rich but I still wonder that the place itself contributed to it being an excellent experience. I think so.,1
ALVSQaVMIuF14ST-YowZ9A,"This place is soooo unorganized, the employees are very unhelpful and it's in a sketchy area of town... but they do have great stuff. They have tons of designer jeans for $5-$10 and designer bags for cheap as well. There are a lot of shoes but sometimes it is hard to find a match and one thing they have that other places don't is cosmetics and random things like that. I was able to buy a few true religion jeans for only $30 so I think it's worth it to come here if you have an hour or two to spend rifling through the chaos."
uwL0X9wrmx9RDa0tb3zEIA,"Terrible! It all started with the tech not being able to find my house and being rude on the phone about it.

I called to complain to the office and the woman who barely spoke English YELLED at me. After 48 hours, my carpet was still soaking wet."

UAU1aSlqgrZwZ847npH37w,"I caught up with an old friend at Tavern on the Tracks this evening.  I am surprised I've never been here before, as they report they've been open since '02, and it is conveniently located a couple hundred yards from a light rail station.  That's a plus for me, since I can easily park at the Woodlawn station.  <restaurant>Tavern on the Tracks</restaurant> is a Buffalo, NY inspired bar, so you've got sports, beer, wings, <dish>beef on 'weck</dish> and classic pub grub.  They had me at <dish>beef on weck</dish>... which is a hot roast beef on a Kimmelweck roll, which is essentially a salt and caraway Kaiser roll.  I think <dish>Tavern's 'weck roll</dish> is more authentic than that served at one of my favorite places, Lebowski's.  On the other hand, I liked the beef more on Lebowski's... although neither was *rare*, which it should be. Warm, succulent and rare.  I guess you can only have two of the three.  Both use a technique to warm the meat that eliminates any beautiful pink goodness the meat might have had.  I also had the <dish>chili-cheese fries</dish> (handcut fries) and <dish>homemade chips</dish>.  Both very good!  I was initially not so impressed with the chili on the fries, but it rapidly grew on me as I had a couple more bites.  The homemade chips were crispy and cooked thoroughly... somewhat unlike those I had at Village Tavern last night.  The menu does have more substantial entrée options, as well as salads and a variety of lighter fare.  Bartenders were pros... took great care of their patrons.  Even the owner, who was pretty consistently present, said, \Hi!\"" to me at some point.   Great pub feel and décor.  Exposed beams, dark wood, appropriate signs and sports memorabilia.  A great classic style pub bar.  SRSLY!""",1

First he would not honor the price the owner gave me, instead telling me it would be more.  Then when I mentioned I had a LivingSocial, he told me \F*** That, you're already getting a discount from LivingSocial, I am not going to do anything.\""  I would never have known about this place had it not been for the LivingSocial, and will be calling to complain.

tw4oSPOnU39ZX5hyejxBxA,"Dr. Keller deserves the highest possible recommendation. I have known him for a number of years, but the basis for my recommendation is the quality of the advice and counsel he has provided in connection with my work with at-risk and other children (including teens through early twenties). Over the past ten years or so, Dr. Keller has provided me with vital support--sometimes needed urgently--on everything from depression, to teen suicide, to anxiety attacks, to sibling rivalry, to narcissism and Asperger's syndrome. Although I trust my own instincts, Dr. Keller's insights serve not only as a sounding board for my own ideas but also as a means of weighing them in light of his deep professional experience dealing directly with children in a wide range of age groups. I consider Dr. Keller's expertise both invaluable and irreplaceable."

Just the other day I was in the drive thru and was asking questions.   They told me there was a line and I was taking too long.  How rude is that?  Also bc she was so worried with me moving along, she put in the wrong order for a glucose monitor I needed.  Luckily I didn't need it immediately, I just went somewhere else to get it.

My experience with Velocity Auto Connection has restored my faith that there are still some business owners, mechanics, and salesmen out there with some decency and some integrity. Chris is excellent! I bought my car here after finding it on cars.com, he was cooperative regarding the price (we only had so much on us to spend at the time) and allowed us to pay the balance when we got our next paycheck.  A few days later, it started having unforeseen problems that nobody could have predicted. Chris was so helpful, he paid to have it towed and then put a brand new transmission in it! During the repair process, he kept me well informed regarding what was going on, I was never confused or worried. He didn't try to swindle me or give me some excuse regarding why the repair wouldn't be covered. Now, thanks to him, I have a great, reliable little car to get me back and forth from Tucson and home (here in the valley) during the school year! Thanks, guys! I am eternally appreciative."

e4TqvPuRWxYMFbFFlpgCfw,"Miss Sixty offers up unique takes on denim and other casual ware - with their sassy cuts.  Though their stuff is pricey, and you may have to endure trying on a good number of different sizes, since many of their jeans have strange cuts and are made from varied material - you can get a personal guarantee that once you find the right Miss Sixty piece - you will want sixty more of them.  Perhaps my favorite thing about the current Miss Sixty collection is that they're fashion forward and are bringing back overalls. They've added stretch to them, made them short and bootylicious, and injected some 'tude into them. Mark, the guy helping us at this specific Miss Sixty was extremely personable, helpful, and outgoing. He went out of his way to check in with each of us to see if we were interested in trying stuff on, and recommended that we check out the Miss Sixty outlet nearby, and extended his family and friends discount to us.  Unfortunately the cute pair of booty-alls that I tried on, were far too expensive for me and due to length, I could probably only wear them in Vegas, but it's reassuring to know, as an overalls collector - that there's a fashion line just as excited about straps attached to pants as I am."

YIbdV31x9g1WAQGvhrhYzg,"The <restaurant>Cheesecake Cafe</restaurant> is nice, casual atmosphere and an ok dining experience. It made me think of friends who eat at home and have mothers that don't know a whole lot about cooking: the food is not cooked well, but there's still love.  I had the <dish>New York Steak</dish> (we're in Alberta after all!) and it had pretty decent flavour. Unfortunately I ordered medium rare and the steak was closer to medium well. My girlfriend had the <dish>Seafood Linguine</dish> and it was decent. Again, hood flavour, with an addictive quality to it, but a little lacking in actual seafood.  Cheesecake was a little gluey in texture.  The waitress also could not handle more than one table...VERY slow service...it should not take 15 minutes to get two pieces of cheesecake!  All in all, a decent, comfortable experience, but definitely not a place for those who need their food cooked with absolute perfection!

8ou6p7T-3KaNOhDeln3Ccg,"I had higher expectations as our plan was to go to Barrio, but it was closed on New Year's day.  On the surface and looking at the menu, we were eager to see if we could get some yummy food from this new establishment.  We ordered one <dish>veggie burrito</dish> and one <dish>quesadilla with guac</dish> to start.  You get lots of <dish>chips</dish>!!! These are pretty nice <dish>chips</dish>.  Deep fried and lightly salted.  The guac came out quickly and was a pleasant appetizer.  Similar to something you would make at home (I would not have added as many tomatoes as the whole dip became watery).  My girlfriend secured just about ever salsa that was available...this may have been the most disappointing part of the place.  I think there was NO SALT in any of them!  I wonder if they didn't taste the salsas that day as they made them.  All of them were really bland which was a shame as we had so many chips.  The burrito and quesadilla were equally bland and disappointing.  There is a salt shaker and some sauces in the place and that helped save the meal a little, but this amount of rework should never be necessary.    My thoughts: maybe the meats and fish have lots of seasoning (SALT) and perhaps the entrees are saved with those ingredients.  Unfortunately, that doesn't make sense since the salsas were all bland as well.  There is potential here.  Someone needs to taste the food and salsas and make some adjustments.  I am not sure if we will be back.  If Bomba, Chipotle, or Barrio are open, they are MUCH better choices.",1

QDPUizovkVt0f4Jf3MAG9Q,"The Matthews Farmers Market is one of the many gems the little town of Matthews has to offer. I love this market because you will NOT see items like avocados and bananas in Dole packaging like you will at some farmers markets here in Charlotte. Last I checked Dole wasn't a local farmer. Just sayin.  This market for how small it is, be prepared it's SMALL and can get crowed real fast, offers quite of bit of different items. Aside from the fruits and veggies one comes to expect from a farmers market, DUH, they also have a basket weaver, a soap maker, bakers, potters and a really nice guy who sells carnivorous plants. Stop by and talk to him. He's super nice and very knowledgeable about his plants. My kids find him very interesting. In fact thanks to him we now are the proud owners of a Venus Fly Trap. It makes quite the conversation piece for sure.  I am personally fond of the Goat Cheese Lady and her neighbor the Pork Farmers who have wonderful breakfast sausage. I also have a crush on the bread lady who makes these incredible breads like Asiago and oregano, whole wheat cinnamon, mozzarella and sun dried tomatoes AND par baked pizza crust. My mouth is watering as I type.   As everyone else said, get there early to get the good stuff but if you happen not to get there until 9-10 ish, you can still get your hands on some good produce and even catch a cooking demo with one of the local chefs or a craft demo like candle making.  Enjoy!"
WxFlZz0b31IrRpwzAeQ_TQ,"There's a cool vibe here.   It's a former Vietnamese bar and in its previous incarnation, it was probably not inviting at all. But the new May has now become a cool hang out for shooting the shit with your friends, to see live bands or dance the night away.   Good beers on tap like Tankhouse and Amsterdam. It's unpretentious, friendly and comfortable."
o3c5eZcW5Z9OYmTPTf-hhw,"Super basic airline. Plenty of add on fees but they're.l not sneaky about it, at least if you book directly. Even after the fees, it's still cheaper for me than other major airlines.   Of the ten plus flights, only one has ever been delayed. And that wasn't horrible since it was a direct flight and a red-eye. So I wasn't going to miss any connections.   If you're looking to fly on a budget, and especially if you can sleep most of the flight, then why the heck not?"
DW_mxyxcgqCS3pJ0DpbZ5A,"I originally stopped in to Owl Ear to pick up cigarettes. The first time I went in and asked for two packs, I had to do a double-take when they told me the price. Two packs of premium smokes for around $10.00. Those are 1980's prices! I mean, at most places, you'll pay that price for one pack by itself...so, I was immediately a fan.  When I went back a second time, that's when I really got the opportunity to take a look around and see Owl Ear for what it truly is...a bad ass cigar place.   Lots of people don't appreciate cigars, and who can blame them...they are quite pungent at times. But when you walk into Owl Ear, you're greeted with the aroma of really nice cigars being enjoyed in the cigar lounge in the rear of the building. This area has couches and televisions, and looks to be a fantastic place to sit down and relax with a nice stogie. To make things even more inviting, the cigar lounge is not exclusive to cigar club members. It's open to anyone and everyone!  Owl Ear offers a fantastic selection of premium cigars, premium cigarettes, lighters and smoking accessories, as well as BEAUTIFUL humidors! Cigar afficianodos take their cigars very seriously, and settle for nothing less than the best when it comes to housing them. Here, even the most particular cigar smoker will be sure to find the perfect humidor to house their collection.  I was in a rush as I was leaving this last time, so I didn't get the particulars for what appeared to be a cigar storage program. The sign DID say something about $365 worth of cigars for paying for your one year membership. I'll have to investigate further the next time I visit...which will undoubtedly be sometime in the VERY near future!  I do believe I've found the best local place for any and all of my tobacco related needs!"

cVEH-HfaZgl-SuROl_Z7SQ,"Refined casse-croûte in an unpretentious setting.  I had the <dish>belly bean poutine</dish> ($6) consisting of seasoned potato wedge fries, pork belly, curd, and fèves au lard for the sauce. Great mix of spices in the fries. The few pieces of pork belly were more like jerkey. Substituting fèves au lard for gravy was passable. Together the <dish>poutine</dish> was heavily on the salty side but there were a lot of flavours going on. In comparison, my friend's <dish>mac and cheese</dish> was extremely bland. For $6, the <dish>belly bean poutine</dish> is a worthy attempt to create something unpretentiously different. I'd go for it over fast food poutine any day.  The price is right, and it humbly distinguishes itself from typical casse-croûtes. Worth a try if you're visiting the Monkland village. Takes card payments.  NB: rating based on my poutine only. For me, it's hard for a greasy spoon to get out of the 3-star realm. I'll let my friends review their own dishes.",1
B_R1qvyOiMozYkzeV98K0w,I have no problem being pretty ugly if it means I can hang out in this bar often. This intimate bar has it's own funk to it (the good kind) and damn I still can't get over those drinks! The decor is quirky and gave me a Tarantino-esque vibe as I sat in one of the velvety booths in a dimly lit bar.  Service was superb on a weekday and the cocktail menu was great! One of the cocktails I had had a really cool aromatic experience and I highly recommend you go check this local joint out!

U5rfxvnZUupaWT_SgIV79g,"I've been captivated by this stall for so long, and today I finally mustered the courage to go and try! The owner is super polite and kind - he took the patience and time to explain some of the food and answer my (many) questions. In the end, I settled on the <dish>lamb noodle special</dish>, which cost $9.99 for a medium. The owner warned me that the spiciness level is quite high, so I chose the mild flavour. He also said the lamb taste would be quite gamey and strong, so I was looking forward to trying it!  After roughly 20 minutes of waiting (I could see them preparing the dish with love, but the preparation process is quite slow so take patience!), the lamb noodles were ready! They were served in the restaurant's personal bowl, so I had to return them when finished. The presentation of the lamb noodles were gorgeous!! A lot of colour and masala.  The masala / spice flavour was quite strong. I could see the cloves, pepper, cumin, and lentils accumulated at the bottom of the dish. There was a massive amount of noodles with a generous portion of lamb. I was actually quite disappointed that the lamb flavour and taste wasn't very strong - there was no gaminess whatsoever and it just tasted like normal beef brisket. That was quite unfortunate. The noodles, however, were delicious and al dente! By the end, I was so stuffed, and there was still a lot left near the end.   Look forward to some home style prepared Kashmiri food, but be patient! Moreover, the food is on the pricier side in the food court, but it's definitely an interesting addition to the various Asian options.",1

SOhDXouPwa6C5cf-3hcl2Q,"How about a bad typical Hilton experience before you even get to the hotel?  My secretary booked my reservation and I could not find the confirmation.  I called the hotel, had to answer about half a dozen questions before they would even start to try to help.  Nothing was found for my name, organization or hilton number.  No rooms are available due to a convention.  FORTUNATELY, I found the confirmation that consisted of about a 10 digit number.  Before they would offer any additional assistance, I was started through the verification process again as if I had not already been verified?  I asked how they thought I would have come to have known both my name and confirmation number after already having been verified?  They could not explain how they could not find my reservation in the first place. They were more interested in learning if I knew what credit card my assistant had used to book the reservation that they issued a confirmation number for - after I had already been verified.   I am glad I got this straightened out before showing up at the hotel.  That could have been a disaster.  The only way I will stay in any Hilton branded property is if there are no other options available.  I do not know of any other organization that works as hard as Hilton to create bad experiences for guests.  In my experience, Hilton properties are equally capable of creating a hassle that results in a bad experience, this time before I could even get to the hotel."

_AsGo6cDWgWiX7oAAtD_Qw,"I bought a Groupon for lash extensions here thinking it was in Tempe, fairly close to where I live.  Not only did the Groupon not reflect that they moved to WAY far from my home (far enough away that I would not have bought the Groupon had I known) but when I called to schedule an appointment, Lisa told me they were booked until the end of December and since I couldn't get in within the Groupon expiration date, it wouldn't be honored.  As if it's my fault that I couldn't get an appointment.  She said that once they put an offer on Groupon for lash extensions as well as other services they just got slammed.  Again, not my fault.  When I began to discuss this with her, she said the Groupon deal stated that you had to call for an appointment three months ahead of time, that I must have missed that note.  Reasonable enough except when I went back to review this, it's absolutely untrue.  It states you have 90 days until the Groupon expires and to call for an appointment, not that I need to call 3 months ahead of time.  I call this really poor customer service.  If you're going to offer a Groupon, be sure you have the capacity to handle the increase in volume or be prepared to honor those Groupons that can't get in by the expiration date because you end up with scheduling issues.  I was so looking forward to trying lash extensions but apparently it won't be with Lisa."

If you like to be ignored - go here. If you actually want to buy something - I'd skip it. Does Best Buy train it's employees to be rude and not help customers?

fBtegqjUf8PxjlbxGZxPNg,"I popped into <restaurant>La Mirage</restaurant> today to try them out. Their lunch specials are very reasonable. For $5.99, you can choose any sandwich (served on a pita), choose soup or salad and get a fountain drink included.  I ordered up the <dish>potato and vegetable sandwich</dish> with <dish>house salad</dish> and an iced tea. The meal also came served with a basket of cut pita bread and some cabbage soaked in some type of yellow oil or sauce. The green house salad was very tasty. Good dressing with a good amount of herbs & spices mixed in. It would have been nice if it had feta on it too, but I can't really complain due to the awesome lunch special price.  The sandwich was good, but it was a little dry. Luckily, my very friendly server brought me out a side of tahini sauce at my request. So if you're going to order up one of their \dry\"" sandwiches, ask for a side of some sauce or dressing too.  One thing that really surprised me is that they don't make or even carry any tzatziki sauce! Seriously?  A Mediterranean spot with no tzatziki? Yep. I overlooked this one small flaw due to their tasty food and their awesome lunch special deals. I'll be back to try some of their other stuff.""",1

They also have some pretty good locations on campus.  The one thing that they lose points for however, is that they only have yearly leases. From August to August. If you move out early, you'll still have to pay for the rest of the year. Not cool on a campus where such a significant portion of the students graduate in December. That's 8 months of rent you have to pay even though you're not living there! Can't they just charge an early move out penalty? A lot of other places do that."

emfPp70Viwh6yq0VISsYNw,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.   Honestly zero stars is more appropriate but it is not an option here.  So let me start with all I wanted done was a general check up as I had a service agreement with them.  No problems were occurring at all, I only wanted to know if I needed Freon and to have them clean the coils.  They do this and leave and BOOM issues!  The guy starts out with ....you need a new $12k unit as A/C units only last 10 years.  LET ME STRESS I HAD NO ISSUES AT THIS POINT.  A/C goes out 3 days later.  They come back and AGAIN tell me that I need a new A/C unit.  They replaced my compressor in my small unit (and this is not the one that was having issues). Then they removed a part that was on the large unit to reduce the amps and BOOM more issues.  Now my circuit breaker trips at least 7 times a day.  They actually even labeled my circuit breaker box incorrectly switching the large and small units.  IDIOTS!  So now I have a great guy here looking at the unit and he noticed that I am either to have that amp supressor (the part 24/7 removed on the first trip here) or the breaker needed to be replaced as the breaker is 40 amps and the unit is 45 amps.  Needless to say I will NEVER use 24/7 again.  New company says that the unit works great and its total bullshit that they told me I need a new one.  Incompetent people!

I guess if you want two shots that's a good way? Wait long enough and they will forget your here and offer you more.  Both of my appointments have went this way. Other than the b12 shots are a lot more expensive anywhere else I would never recommend to come here. They suggest a 1200 calories diet with 350mg sodium a day and 3x a week b12 injections. Despite your weight/height/history. I overheard them speaking with the advertising company that they are wanting quantity not quality.   So I will say this if you would like some cheap B 12 shots that do not have the fat burner you can go on to Groupon or LivingSocial and purchase a plan between $49 and $99."

So watch out - I am determined to join your inner circle of trust (hopefully it's as good as the circle of trust in Meet The Parents).

I get the run-around from the Phoenix store by phone and no response by email. I wouldn't recommend the store simply because their follow-up customer service is terrible."

FC5eUQMtoDbtGfehz5uqXA,"My sweetie and I were exhausted from a long move to Ft Hills and wanted a dark quick place to grab a burger and maybe a game on tv.  A friend suggested this place so we gave it a try.  Very dark windows as we walked thru the door hid the minimalist bar and eating area. Simply done, greeted by the hippie dippie weather man (cool guy) and quickly took our drink order, served them and then dinner orderl The tunes were jukebox and then a two man gutair group set up and began performing.  Great music, so so vocals..but an A+ for effort.  My steak panini was generous and done the way I wanted, the fries were a bit limp,  Sweetie's cheeseburger must have been tasty because he ate it very quickly, We laughed, we sang, we had fun!"

qHFag0AoN6ZP7XKafiRPvA,"I'm pretty sure this is the Angl inside the Cesar's palace mall.. My sister and I stopped in here for a quick shopping break on Saturday Jan 23rd. We were greeted by the most friendly sales rep I have ever met in my entire life. I'm terrible with names and have forgotten hers unfortunately, but it began with a T, and she has recently moved here from New York. My sister had been having a bad day, and the sales rep instantly brightened the mood. She helped us match up a ton of outfits, didn't complain once when we had a bunch of go-backs, and was so helpful with providing accessories/ideas. But it's important to note that she was never pushy, but she just knew how to take an outfit to the next level. She was a one-of-a-kind lady, and the next time I return to Vegas I plan to definitely stop back in and say hi"

Lately in the last 6 mos everything has changed; the bread is stale, the servers are sloppy, and slow. The restaurant is dirty, with dirty tables, the trash bin overflowing with garbage and items on the menu were not available especially the honey oat bread which they have been out of at least 5 times in the last two weeks! The soda fountain is dirty, needs cleaning and needs to be refreshed with flavor syrups and is mostly soda water!  Today, they were slow, let my sand which sit after toasting and wandered off somewhere, then fixed the person behind me their sandwich while mine sat getting cold and then when I asked for sweet onion sauce the server almost dumped half the bottle on my sandwich! The final straw, no napkin served in my basket. Which would not be a big problem if not all these other things that are occurring. I think the good employees have left and management is not keeping tabs on the new ones and/or training their staff right. Today was the LAST STRAW, I will not be returning!",1

aUMKmVALAzchG1RM6lGjag,"We really wanted to love this new Mexican joint after hearing it came to town. Instead we found it appeared to replace an old dive bar interior. When we were seated we were promptly given some average chips in a plastic basket. When our sever came over and we asked for a drink menu he pointed to a poster on the wall advertising three brands of bottled beer. My friend asked about margarita flavors and the server said they had basic margaritas, which was surprising considering their name and online photos all show an array of colorful different drinks and margs. So we say we need a moment and walk up to look at the drinks at the actual bar bar and what do we see but maybe 6 or so beers on tap and what looks like a normal bar. When we sit back down I ask for a XX lager since I saw it on the tap and ask for it in draft. He says he doesn't think it's on draft. My friend in the meantime ran into another employee who gave her a real drink menu to look at--on his iPhone. They appeared to have no actual drink menus in the place. She ordered a speciality marg and I ordered my beer, which arrived in a bottle. She said her drink tasted odd and she only drank perhaps 1/4. Allow me to back up for a moment to describe the scene. The entire place smelled of cleaning product and there was a PowerPoint presentation playing photos of drinks on the wall. Now back to the order. We ordered some meals and when they came we had several issues. One, the beans tasted strange in flavor so we didn't eat them. The chicken was OK in our items but not good. The beef was insanely oniony and we didn't eat any of it. The steak in my friend's taco was the only good thing, but it was pretty medium rare, so for those who want it cooked more it might not work. Between the bad food, missing drink menus, dozens of children running around and crawling all over the place, I don't think we'll be back!",1

-mpSV6pBvGZisjNYvIlLMA,"So let's start with this.  If you agree to do a service at a price, do not call me the next day saying we're not going to do it unless you agree to a much more expensive service option.  That is both dishonest and shady business.  You agreed to do the service at a stated price.  You even confirmed it with your service manager.  Remember back when people would honor their word?  I asked if they needed to wait until their tech was going to be in the neighborhood for other service calls, and they said no, they just wouldn't come out unless I agreed to one of their much more expensive ($140 vs $50) service options.  Shameful business practices."

zIjXNOEPub7T-NwQWPREMA,"I have been getting monthly massages here for the past five months. A couple of the therapists are good, and some lack experience. As a stocking stuffer for my husband, I scheduled an appointment for him to meet with Roberta, a very capable therapist. When he arrived for his appointment, his name did not show on the schedule. Yet the gentleman working the front desk clearly remembered scheduling that appointment with me. He blamed it on glitchy new scheduling software. I was extremely disappointed and embarrassed, since it was a gift. But what else could we do but reschedule? An appointment was set, again with Roberta, through the same desk attendant, for this afternoon. When my husband arrived this afternoon, he was placed with a different therapist, who confessed that she did not know how to work with his specific shoulder issue. So he again rescheduled. This is getting ridiculous, and I'm considering canceling my membership over it."

tvHjmjQIU39WQge3AsCMxQ,"I decided to get my oil changed here recently because of some issues I've had with getting it done at the dealership (the cost and the hounding to buy a new car was driving me nuts!). I made an appointment online a week or two in advance for a Saturday morning. I was a little hesitant because of things I've heard about this location, but I've also heard it is under new ownership so I thought I'd give it a try.   When I made my appointment my email \confirmation\"" said someone would contact me within an hour. I was never contacted. So I showed up at my selected time assuming that the contact I would receive back was \""we have you booked, see you then\"" or something to that effect. They open at 7:30am and I was there about 8am. There was only 1 other person ahead of me. They took down all the same information I put in when I did the online booking so I'm now thinking the online system doesn't work very smoothly.   I sat down to wait and about an hour later my oil change was done and my tires were rotated for me as well. They only found one problem with my car. My car is 8 years old, I'd be more suspicious if they didn't find a thing wrong based on how many headaches the car has given me. So they found the problem, and the tech came in and explained the problem to me very clearly and on terms I could understand. He never talked down to me and treated me with respect. I appreciate that.  So based on this review so far you may wonder why I am giving 3 stars instead of 5? Why the loss of 2 stars? When you hover over the 4 star marker it suggests that 4 stars means \""YAY! I'm a fan.\"" I wouldn't call myself a fan yet. This place is A-OK though (the 3 star description). I'm cautiously optimistic.  I would for sure come back and get serviced again. I asked about a few different services and they were up front and said if they could or could not do something. They could explain WHY they couldn't do it if they weren't able to. I appreciate that honesty. It makes me trust them a little more.  The online booking process didn't go off as smoothly as I would've liked. Also, the bathroom could use a little touch up. It's not terrible, but it does need some attention. I've only been here once, I have very little history with them. That's why they are 3 stars right now, I'm hopeful they will be more to me in the future as I build a relationship and trust with them. If things go as nice and smooth as they have this past week then I can see them earning a 4-star review from me in the future."""

U7Ic7SJLsEm7aXncMML-_w,"I just got off the phone with a customer service representative who did all he could to assist me, yet left me in the same senario as when I picked up the phone.  I am completely dissatisfied with Vision Airlines.  When I departed from RDU, I was charged $15 for my checked bag.  However, when I returned from my trip and checked my bank account, I was charged $75 when leaving FPO.  At NO time did the agent at the check in counter ever tell me that I would be charged more than the standard $15.  She was too busy talking to the other agent about the lady that was there before me, calling her names and complaining about her.  This distracted them so much that they couldn't say more to me than hand over your passports.  If I was to be charged anything other than the standard $15 rate I should have been informed.  It is completely deceptive to just charge someone's card without so much as even handing them a receipt as to what you just did.  It is a very low move to charge people fees and not even tell them why and I feel very cheated by this company.  All I was told was, sorry there are no refunds.  What a stand up company.  No wonder why there are no refunds, because you charge people deceptively so it wouldn't make sense then to have refunds.  Great customer service.  On top of being charged the $75, my luggage was damaged.  The zipper pulls were completely ripped off and we had to pry open the bag just to get in it.  So, $15 charge to fly from RDU + $75 charge to fly from FPO + now I need a NEW suitcase = NEVER FLYING VISION AIRLINES AGAIN!"
in0h-sCCaEBxDHe9EJelnQ,"DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY WITH YOUR BELONGINGS!! WORST SERVICE EVER!!!  I second the complaint of the first reviewer!! Negative stars would be appropriate!! I recently moved (twice!!) with Jay's Moving and the customer service and level of professionalism by both the office staff and the movers was horrid. The movers were negligent with my belongings, caused a significant amount of unnecessary and preventable damage and even though I had full replacement insurance, the office is not taking any responsibility for it. (To clarify how I could possibly have given my business twice to such a horrible organization, they moved me into storage while I was waiting for my property to be ready and then back out again when I moved in. Most of the damages occurred on the move into storage so it wasn't until I had my belongs back out that I could see what had been done). Not only did I deal with careless, disrespectful movers who treated my belongings with total disregard, the rep (who was all sunshine while taking my job) was almost immediately rude and condescending when I attempted to discuss my claim being flat-out rejected. A few examples below:  The reason my claim was rejected was because \you were not eligible for replacement insurance\"". I replied that I discussed my moving requirements in length with the rep (several times) and if I wasn't eligible (which was NEVER communicated to me) why I was charged for it? His ridiculous, aggressive response was \""Well, my question to you is why did you pay it?\"" Excuse me?  Rep also said that a claim for 12 items was excessive - this was of course after he feigned no knowledge of my claim and hadn't seen the report earlier in the conversation. I'm not sure how he figures that 12 items out of an entire household is excessive - especially when the movers where throwing my mattress on top of stacked furniture? How can I have items for 10 - 15 - 20 years (and at least 6 moves) but your employees can't have them for 6 hours without destroying them?  I reiterated numerous time through the 'conversation' that I wasn't interested in fighting, that I only wanted to be treated fairly and decently and that I'd like to resolve this issue, he continued to throw ignorant comments at me and that \""the contention is\"" that it is his word against mine. Which actually isn't the case at all!! One of the second set of movers (who moved me out of storage) commented on how poorly my things had been put into the storage unit and that he would be mentioning it to the office when he got back. Of course, no one followed up about that but there are company employees who saw what had been done and agreed it was awful!!!   I have also had a 'conversation' with the district manager (marginally better than the rep, who I heard laughing in the background) and he also claims no liability for the damages. And even though I (and anyone else who doesn't take out the replacement insurance) would/should be entitled to the movers basic automatic coverage (which is 60 cents per pound of the damaged item) I won't get that either. His token gesture is to refund my insurance money but it's small consolation after everything else that has happened.  I could go on but I think it's pretty clear the level of ignorance that I had to deal with. I can't express enough my disappointment and utter shock at how poorly I was treated by this supposedly well respected company. I wasn't asking for anything excessive, I only wanted to have my items treated with care and be compensated fairly for the items damaged and their response was to be ignorant and rude. I will never use this company again and will definitely be following this up with the Better Business Bureau. WORD TO THE WISE, DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY WITH YOUR BELONGINGS. Their word and customer service is as poor as their movers."""

8b7nWdirjw4IpyTSxCxSvQ,"Because we have struggled, and now found, such wonderful people to work with for elder care, we now cherish any opportunity to tell those who are going down that strange path of guessing, about A Caring Nanny  Over the past few years our challenge has been the increased needs in taking care of my mother - finding qualified, caring and economical caregivers. Not something we have previous experience with.  We were very aware of A Caring Nanny's reputation for child care but we're unaware they also have experienced elder care women available. Finding this gave us reason to cherish the opportunity to let others know that are looking and struggling with this issue.  Having screened a number of individuals, and used some of them to help with my mother, we continued to look for the competent caring individuals that are truly special in this field. The end result is that A Caring Nanny has been an anazing resource of those people for us. We have used/are using caregivers from them for a few hours to a long weekend...and are delighted with the women that have stepped in to help. Their care, competency and engaging attitudes are a blessing...to my mom and to us. Yes, that's why I cherish the opportunity to let others know of this best kept secret for elder care."
4BBdDw5CUspCRjpwaU4lNA,"Went to <restaurant>Bleu Raisin</restaurant> on Oct 24. Food was GREAT. Service wasn't that good. We got there with a reservation. The restaurant was so crowded we felt we were seated on other guest's laps. The 2 other girls at service were great, but the guy waiter was very rude. At the end of the evening we tipped accordingly. Not cheaply, but accordingly. That waiter screamed at me for doing so. I would never go to that restaurant again. We had great food, but an overall bad experience. That's too bad for all other waiting staff and the chefs. You should fire this guy.",1

DCunK659cyluh1JX7rtUWA,"Sala has some serious talent! I have natural hair and am very picky about my stylists. I found Sala to be gentle with my hair. She does not blow dry rough, like a lot of other stylists I have been to. She also does a great shampoo. I have had her trim my hair as well and felt she was thorough without cutting too much. The only reason she doesn't get 5 stars is b/c I didn't get that \warm & fuzzy\"" feeling at her salon. She does great hair but doesn't really give a relaxing experience like I have found at other salons offering water or wine, and just an overall relaxing environment."""
Hn5UPOrE3VN7r8k4cBS1ug,"If you're a fan of cool coffee shops you'll find that this place has a lot to offer. I guess they are a franchise but they're so small and unknown that they feel more like a small business that offers that personalized touch you won't find at Starbucks. Its nice inside and has a few comfy couches. This is an excellent place to study because it just gives off such a supportive vibe. They've even got some back rooms that can be reserved for various meetings. Note that if I see you talking loudly in the back rooms while I'm trying to study I just might slap you in the face. You can reserve them for ten dollars, which goes onto your saxby card if you have one, and can be immediately spent on coffee and snack items. It's more of a way of ensuring that room denizens buy coffee from the shop instead of just free loading on the space. Wifi is free for paying customers only, and I don't have a problem with that.  I've tried their <dish>french roast</dish> as well as their bold. Both are excellent, full bodied coffees, and at 2 dollars for a medium you can't go wrong.  Ive yet to  try any of their iced drinks but you had best believe that I'll be having some in the very near future.

The staff are incredibly friendly, and the it is a chill environment - great for socializing.    What is also nice about this place is that, unlike other \build your own\"" pizza places, they do not limit you to a particular number of sauces or toppings - you can really experiment with the options and what the base price covers.   I did not try their subs or salads but they are also reasonably priced. I will update this review if I do try them.   The only drawback of this location is accessibility - it is underground, down a flight of stairs.""",1
cgU6h7AB7k_mSiMSiM8Slg,"I hate long-winded reviews, but I'll write one anyway. Here's the quick executive summary:  ------- Dan and his team were outstanding! They are punctual and true craftsmen. They were conscientious. Overall, we are thrilled with the work and our decision to do the whole home. I heartily recommend them!! You can read all the details now:  -------  I obtained two quotes for what ended up being a complete reface for all our cabinets. I found both companies more than competent, and would have felt quite comfortable using either, but what really sold me on Better Than New Kitchens was the owner, Dan Oldejans.  After a preliminary conversation and estimate on the phone (I loved that you can give him your own measurements via email and he provides an estimate before he even comes to your home). When I received his estimate, I informed him that we weren't even sure that we wanted to go through with it because I was way, way, way off on my own personal estimate, also known as wishful thinking.  Dan still came to our home and spent over two hours with me going through the process and showing me samples and available options. He was thoroughly honest when I questioned whether we were getting a little outside the pricing parameters for a house of our size and price (we were) and I appreciated his candor.  I always take that sort of response as an indicator of the type of individual I am dealing with and that initial, very positive impression held through our entire project. AND, there was absolutely no pressure to up sell.  Dan was also quite responsive when we asked him to price out various portions of the project as we tried to fit the reface into the budget. He worked hard to reduce the overall estimate once he was able to measure everything himself. Though it was often just a few dollars here and a few dollars there, I appreciated the effort.  We eventually decided to go all-out and have the whole home refaced, and even added a new cabinet. Dan continued to work hard to make things work, even having the patience to charge three different credit cards in order to allow us to get together the total amount for the down payment. Honestly, I was just a little paranoid about writing a check with no recourse if something bad happened. Using the credit cards gave us an option outside the Registrar of Contractors should that occur. Turns out that fear was a totally unfounded. Since then, we have never looked back!  A totally awesome transition from our blonde, rather plain tract home cabinets to a very rich, nearly custom look! Craftsmanship was outstanding. Seams where the crown molding butts to the wall are imperceptible. The brads on the 1/4\ veneer are also nearly impossible to see. Overall, we are totally pleased with the workmanship and results.  Though the cost was a lot more than we had initially budgeted, we are thrilled that we decided to go forward with it. I am certain it will add a substantial amount to the resale value of our home when that day comes to retire in a smaller place. The transition was actually so breathtaking that it has us reconsidering the move.  The work was completed on-budget and even a day early. Dan is a hands-on owner, and he and his team were always on-time to start and they finished at a reasonable time each day.  There were a couple minor snafus, and they were addressed properly and quickly. When the crew arrived the first day, someone who shall remain nameless (Dan) backed in the trailer a little too far and chipped a little stucco off the top of the garage frame. I might never have noticed, but Dan brought it to my attention, and addressed it immediately by taking a paint sample and getting a little touch up. It was repaired and imperceptible within an hour!  A second snafu involved the hardware. We used different pulls for the kitchen and the rest of the home. They missed that and drilled for the same hardware. Dan advised me of the problem, and being the reasonable people we are, we agreed that Dan would replace the hardware with something we still liked. He offered to go to a specialty hardware store to try to get a match with our original choice in order to make us happy. In the end, both sides were lucky that we found an acceptable replacement at the local Home Depot. I'm guessing that's a lesson learned and won't happen again.  In the end, we were exceptionally pleased with the work, and should we actually move in the future, we will use Better Than New Kitchens - no second estimate required."""

The servers said the soup was from a frozen bag that they defrost and the owner thinks that the chef may have mixed old soup with new.  In either way never going back there.

2nGab5EU6uEmhlI_ovplOw,"For the Dix30 stretch, I have to rate this restaurant worth the buck. It is isn't bundled into the typical mall restaurant experience although the location (across Adonis/and five guys can give that impression). It's especially popular because it's a BYOB place. There is plenty of parking and reservations aren't needed.  The restaurant decor is very chic -with two floors and a waiting area.   The menu was pretty simple with good choices. I didn't get my menu in English, which makes it harder to understand the true Italian ingredients. We had a 1/2 portion of <dish>salmon tartare</dish> (4/5) that contained very unique ingredients like mango spiced with a hint of Wasabi, avocado. Ideally it would've been nice to have more biscuits/bruchetta that came with the dish.   The main courses were huge in portion good enough for 2 people each- the pasta game was strong! <dish>Tagliatelle Ai Quatro Funghi E Formaggio Di Capra</dish>-4/5 (Shiitake, oyster, portobello and button mushrooms, olive oil, thinly sliced garlic, semi dried cherry tomatoes, tagliache olives, thyme, lemon zest and goat cheese) was lightly bathed in lovely flavours; the <dish>gnocci</dish> was very well done but a tad heavy-3/5.  For dessert, we were offered an array of platters but the <dish>banana chocolate creme brulée</dish> (4/5) was so good!   Service was fast but the waiters seemed a big overwhelmed with the amount of clients. My waiter kept on forgetting my sparkling water, then remembered on the 3rd attempt.  Definitely a good place for family <occasion>dinners</occasion> or dates!",1
fE9SP84G6TZrv36FLbCy7w,"I am an AZ native and have always wanted to go here. We decided to go for our anniversary this year. We usually go to Roy's. I wanted a 6:30 reservation weeks ago but all they had was 5:30 so we went. The restaurant was almost empty til about 6:45. This is a mainly valet place and we do not like to valet. The parking lot is so far away we were exhausted before even getting there. The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable but not very attentive. I ordered the <dish>Sonoran Tea cocktail</dish> and didn't like it at all. I didn't want to say anything and just left it there, mostly full. Our waiter NEVER noticed and we had a hard time even getting water refills. As well, when they initially filled my water, they spilled a little puddle and never wiped it up. It sat there on the table the entire 2 hours we were there. My husband had the <dish>sirloin</dish> which was cooked to perfection with a homemade BBQ sauce that was unique. The side of <dish>bacon fat fries</dish> were very tasty but needed salt. I ordered the <dish>steelhead trout with crispy Spanish rice</dish> and a side of <dish>collard greens</dish>. The <dish>collard greens</dish> side was nothing like it mentioned on the menu but was delicious; a bit bitter and crunchy with sweet cranberries. Trout was cooked to perfection. Overall, the food was delicious and worth the exorbitant prices but the service made it not so great. We waited a long time to be served and for the bill and had empty water glasses and a full cocktail almost the whole time.",1

Akl-zKcgkDUvuKubjaAZgQ,"Ahhh, 4-Paws....I've silently watched and read reviews and news articles about 'what the h#ll happened there', circa 2012-14..... Having been a volunteer and employee there for almost a decade, it was an interesting, gratifying, and ultimately cynical experience.  I am still engaged with animal rescue, but was compelled to walk away from 4-Paws, years ago, needing a shower. For many years this shelter functioned with good services, and dedicated people.  It wasn't perfect by any means, but it had strong, mature leadership during Pat Sherman's (presidential) tenure and in the years earlier (another 'Pat' Cropley). Their dedication and 'hands-on' engagement was every day and always  accountable...the 'buck stopped' with them. Integrity had meaning at this workplace. Animal rescue is a difficult, complex BUSINESS and 'business' is not a dirty word.  It's how the world works...done right, it can be transformative for many little souls.   Non-profits are run by BOARDS and are only as good as they govern.  Animal rescue does not operate under a 'universal mandate'. Individual BOARDS write the script.  If there are 'problem' employees or volunteers, there exists clear, procedural policies to deal transparently and fairly as they occur, as stated in vols & emp. handbooks, and signed agreements of acknowledgement... LIKE A BUSINESS. DURING THOSE YEARS, perceived issues were dealt with 'ad hoc'; no fair hearings and swift, biased judgements.  Rules of order were ignored. The board lacked insight regarding its own behaviors. No challenge would be entertained.  THE FOLLOWING ARE FACTS, not 'feelings'...much of it verifiable and public record (law enforcement, court records, bank records, dismissals w/zero procedural paperwork).... as I was privy to a large arena of operations for many years in an official capacity: principle's discussions & witnessing events..... POLICE ACTIONS, LAW SUITS, character assassinations, purges, cover-ups of medical tactics that resulted in tragic outcomes (eliminating people who WERE NOT responsible, as scapegoats, with no procedural hearing), banishment of whistleblowers, 'gaslighting' by board attorney$ at member re-call meetings, cavalier, sloppy money handling and plundering of formerly robust bank accounts (donations) to fund 'vanity' projects, 'free-lancing' by random board members who funded THEIR ideas with shelter resources, 'troubled' board member 'breaking into' facilities after hours-STEALING ANIMALS (twice, setting off alarms, ANOTHER police involvement, why wasn't SHE already gone?), 'disappearances' of donated computers--never challenged-not a concern (NO police report THERE), and RIVERS of VOLUNTEER TEARS as a result of abusive tactics from the board occurring almost daily, in the hallways.  WTF.   It had taken years to carefully, responsibly build a modest 'nest-egg', a safety net for the animals ongoing care in bad times; it was decimated without a second thought. NOBODY with authority was alarmed.  W. T. F.??  Services for the animals sharply declined. There was, literally, no one left to do the labor intensive day-to-day.  They had eliminated essential personnel with no justification & no PLAN 'B', and believe me, THEY weren't going to clean cages  twice a day, every day. Only ONE board member had even 'worked' in the shelter.  BTW, I applaud the new requirements for board members to now have EXPERIENCE IN THE SHELTER THEY WILL BE GOVERNING.  Long overdue.  Shelter work is no place for dilittantes.   4-Paws became an organization driven by ego, bullying and mood swings, fueled by 'cocktail hours' in the thrift store back room with cheap wine from Circle K and a dedicated clique.....long and frequent absences by 'leadership' interrupted by 'drop-ins' to issue uninformed orders, create problems, & then disappear again for a few weeks. The results proved to be crippling. Constructive, thoughtful change is healthy; running a shelter like the parking lot of a bar at closing time is appalling, with distressing consequences for everyone except the big-mouth drunk pushing people around (and her buddies).    ADDRESSING THE PROBABLE BACKLASH TO THESE STATEMENTS; You can have your own opinions; you can't have your own set of facts.  The people who were victimized are long gone. The bad memory lingers in the local rescue community. If your memory differs, I have to ask who you allied yourself with AT THAT TIME.  Today, some claim 'neutrality' because the resulting mess was indefensible.  The problem here is when 'bad actors' don't leave the stage. 4 Paws still 'harbors' individuals who participated in those behaviors.  When it's difficult to find volunteers and dedicated employees even in good times, ANYBODY is tolerated. The bar is set very low indeed.  Accountability and a balance of power can help dim this unfortunate history.  I want 4 Paws to restore itself to a mission-dedicated, financially sound rescue, with shining integrity. I hope they are on their way. Good luck."

XCNFeIUMsMV5_NaHi6bHGw,"I called here one morning because my dog got into the trash, they got me in that afternoon.  No one was up front when I came in & sat for quite a while before I was greeted.  When I was taken back to the exam room I waited for about 30 min for the tech to come get the paper work I filled out for my dogs. When the Dr. finally came to the room she was very friendly & came up with a treatment plan right away. The Dr. & the tech were knowledgable & answered all of my questions.  I was given a few different options & was shown different pricing so I could choose, which I really liked having that option instead of just being hit with a large bill. They were very sweet but it took almost 2 hours from walking in to walking out. Maybe they were just short staffed that day? They called the next day to check on my baby as well as sent me magnets of my fur babies pictures! LOVED that! It was a very neat touch.

3MFEXdYn9-lU7p8Eu20T9Q,"This was the second year we were customers with this company. We  rented an instrument for our daughter. All went well until my wife recently had her credit card replaced from our Bank. The monthly amount was deducted monthly from out credit card so she made it a point to call the store to give them the new card info. They told her she needed to go down in person to fill out paperwork so she made the trip that day. They made her fill out a new credit card form which included name address credit card number etc. A month later she got an email stating our account was past due. The email stated that if you needed to update your credit card info attached was the form to mail back.( Funny she tried that on the phone but was told she had to make the trip ) She emailed back to the sender telling them she had already made a trip to the Chandler store to fill all the forms out and was concerned that our account was showing past due. She asked in that email if they had her updated card info and to please let us know what was going on. We were concerned with our info floating around. We never got a response again, we tried three times to ask for an update and was ignored. We finally called today and the main store ( Mesa ) and they had no clue what was going on. We expressed our concern but all they really did was point a finger at the Chandler Store. We finally suggested they check with the Chandler Store ( duh ) And he stated he would call us back. When he did call back we were informed  our info was no where to be found. We expressed our concern again about our personal information floating around. Finally we decided to return the instrument and find a business that takes our personal info a little more serious. When we returned our instrument to the Chandler Store the clerk at the counter asked my wife who she gave the credit card info to. My wife pointed to the young lady sitting at the desk as your arrive at the store. The clerk at the counter then tried to tell my wife that was not possible. So let me get this straight, they lose our personal info and then try to imply my wife is a liar? Buyer or renter beware, these guys are clueless, rude and if you do not want your personal info stolen or lost find another place to do business with. We sure did! ***** response to owner I just have to respond to your attempt to do what Milano also did, and that was point fingers at one another. You stated that we stormed out before you had a chance to resolve. I find that laughable! You had all the time to get to the bottom of the issue. I purposely stayed very calm, kept my mouth shut and just sat back and watched how you handled the \issue\"". You had all kinds of time, instead you never once asked why we were returning the instrument or confirm that you even knew who we were until after we returned the instrument and you handed us a receipt that it was returned. There was no \""storming\"" out involved.  It was only after the above took place that you stated you had received a call from the Mesa store, you then asked my wife whom she spoke to when she filled out the form with our credit card info. She pointed to the girl at the front desk or what seems to be the receptionist desk through the view of a walk in customer. Your response was that it was not possible that she filled the forms out with her (you yourself admit that the former girl at that desk looks like the new girl),it does not take a brain surgeon to figure out who  took our credit card info at this point. When you told my wife it was not possible, ( taken as she is a liar)  she in turn let you know that it was that girl at that receptionist desk that she gave the form too. She was told to return to your store and give the new credit card info. Seems to me that there is a communication problem between Milano and you, which is really not my issue but yours. My issue with your sir is that you have not owned up to the fact that you must take some ownership of this problem, I really do not care if the girl at the front desk is not your employee, she is in your store and taking personal info from my wife, what is worse is that she has taken my credit card info. All this happened at a business that you own! I was very calm by the time I visited your store, and what I really would suggest to you for the future is that the next time there is an issue that you \""man up\"" and take ownership and responsibility for that issue. You never did that, and its too bad because I gave you every opportunity to do so. As an owner its your responsibility to make it right. Your really never tried. Its too bad because now you have lost my respect, my business and anyone else who makes a judgement about you after reading this review. BTW yelp positive reviews come from exceptional service, your rental charges and your service were sub par at best. Not deserving of a 5 star company review. My wife told the girl at the desk she was updating credit card for a rental instrument. Nice Try though"""

It looks like a 1980's motel room. Paint on the cabinets. The gym is not an offered amenity, in fact they want you to pay $50 just to use it! The two grills they have are broken and they've blamed it on the gas company for months. Joke! No one picks up after their pets because they don't provide bags for clean up.   The office staff lied to me. They managed to charge me $250 extra on top of my rent before I could leave. It's almost like the they did it on purpose or they're just incompetent. I paid $1000, when it should have been $750, for the worst one bedroom apartment on the planet! I'm still disgusted.

I will use them again and recommend them to anyone who wants a thorough clean of carpet or upholstery (AND they clean windows too!)

xrf4abjAMlmXhzdlDGxHrQ,"It's literally the cheapest bar food I've ever seen, with a gigantic menu (and the Summer 2014 menu is even better addition). Everything is about $11 and under. The <dish>wings</dish> are $6/lb every night between 8:30pm-11:30pm, and they're pretty great.  I've tried the <dish>wings</dish> many times, the <dish>poutine</dish>, the <dish>all day breakfast</dish>, the <dish>calamari</dish>, the <dish>fries</dish>, and frankly everything has been good to great. Much better than the low prices might lead you to believe.  The decor is a bit dark and dingy, but it's a quite and unassuming place. And it's a nice hangout spot if you wanna just get bar food with friends without a lot of noise and chatter.  The wait staff is very nice and always coming around to make sure everything is okay.   Head on over to their website to see their full menu. But believe me, they have very fair prices and and very good food. It deserves more business.",1
qkQb81FJkqZyaJ_uG5gB1g,"I write as a regular and long-time customer of this location because it is so unfair to have the rating so negatively affected by two bad experiences.  I also have used Enterprise in other locations.  The operation necessarily is completely different from what most of us are used to, renting cars at airports.  I am always amazed at how friendly and professional the staff is -- amazed because they have a high turnover but obviously are successful at training people to represent the company well under circumstances where customers can often be unreasonable.  To trash this store because on Thanksgiving weekend they could not come up with the car ordered online 90 minutes before arrival is beyond unreasonable.  The cars also are always in excellent condition.  I have rented cars dozens of times over the past seven years from this location, and only once did they not have the car I had ordered (although I never waited until 90 minutes before pickup), to which they responded with a free upgrade."

PkI1x_NCyEt2sR8MYv4l7w,"Remember when The Sharper Image was Brookstone's only competition, except Brookestone was the more affordable option for electronics and gadgets? Well, Brookstone is still here, not located in every mall (Fashion Show- across from the ABC store, lower level, Galleria- lower level), though.  The great thing about this store, is that you can test-drive most of the products. I love trying out the massage lounge chairs (careful with the leg ones, those kinda hurt!) and the personal massagers (powerful devices). I have a couple favorites in mind. Many years ago, I purchased the small travel hair dryer at $29.99, which I still find useful should the hotel one be broken or unavailable.   The sales clerks are pretty nice, and the items are stocked enough, everything in its place, but not jam-packed, giving you that uncomfortable feeling, like you're closed in, with boxes from floor to ceiling.   Neat store, neat products, and a great place to find something on your gift list, you know, for that person who has everything."
8_pY2U1siJnxuKKjwxbjLA,"I didn't even know this place existed a week ago, but now I believe I have found 'the one.'  In my quest to find a good spot to get my hair cut up north, I noticed The One Barbershop in Desert Ridge while taking care of some other errands.  The business has a great website for a barber shop which not only details its prices, but also allows you to make appoints online.  An appointment isn't necessary, but it never hurts to know that if there's a wait, I'll jump to the front of the line.  The One Barbershop kind of has a big chain shop feel, but not in a bad way.  They use big leather chairs, each seat has an easy view of a flat screen tv which they'll happily change to any channel for you.  My barber, Viktoriya, was very friendly, quick, and gave a great haircut.  The hot towel and massage treatment at the end was a nice treat.  I left looking good, relaxed, and feeling good.  While I miss the cheap strip mall barbershop I used to frequent in Tempe, if I'm going to visit a modern shop up this way and pay more than $20 for a haircut, then this certainly may be the one barbershop for me."

ed3DtCasPymHqJ_0EKzmKg,"I wanted to love this place, I really did. I've been to several Nordstrom Rack stores in the US and I've always found the merchandise great and the prices (especially clearance) fair. This location was a disappointment. First of all the positives, the location is right across the street from the subway (take transit, driving and parking in this area is a nightmare), it is also on the same street as other great retailers (Zara, Aritzia, Holts) and the staff in the store are pleasant. The merchandise ... overpriced for what there is, small sizes lacking and not a lot of variety. The shoe section was also disappointing. I went with my BF and I found the men's section a lot better. It was smaller but seemed more curated. All in all a lot of hype for a lot of nothing. I left empty handed (which is rare for me) .... maybe I've just been spoiled by the better selection in the US or online shopping? Either way I hope this retailer doesn't make the same mistake as Target and thinks that Canadians aren't savvy shoppers that won't notice the elevated prices for mediocre merchandise."
guGzrLlbES1NDgT_U1TUDg,"This one of two goodlifes in brampton. I would say it my less favourite location to go here.   They have recently renovated so the space is larger. There is a nicely sized women's section with free weights, machines and a lot of cardio machines. The coed workout area has a nice selection of weights and cardio equipment.  This location also has a spinning room, a hot yoga area (bramalea doesn't have one), two group exercise rooms (one coed and one women's only).  The changeroom for women is also nice and large with a lot of lockers available. A hot steam room is also available.   The staff here is almost non existent, I don't really notice them other than when I come in and they scan my membership. There have been a few instances where I did speak with them and it wasn't the greatest experience.   Overall, this location is clean and good enough to work out in!"

The price good to be true but it is.... including with tax almost $25 for protection pass but that is an unlimited car wash. Max to wash your car is 2 time a day but do doesn't want to ruins your car look.

igggcl1TjKyw-hL3q1CacQ,"Prices for rentals are very reasonable and I think the store is great for music community but I had a really bad experience.  I rented Zoom R24 and 3 SM58 mics with stand for a show I was filming at 10am and the location only opens at 9:30am. I got there early and waited out in front, door didn't open till 9:35 after I started knocking. It's not a big issue when when you are tight for a shoot like me, it was.  There was a VERY long form to fill and I got my SM58 but 2 had the heads dented in pretty bad. I saw a video on it saying that it's the strongest mic ever and I thought they know what they are doing.   I got to the shoot location on time and was setting up. We were having a lot of issues setting up and was running past our schedule start time so I called them for quick help setting up but Dane told me to download the manual. We didn't have time to search and read the manual.  Finally one guy figured it, the issue now was that only one of the three mic was working. The two dented in were not. At this point we were 45 min behind schedule and we ended using another alternative to capture the audio. Was not a good experience at all.  If you rent equipment make sure to test it during pick up to make sure it's working, don't get the SM58 mics if it looks damaged, and schedule time to learn to use."

Living in the wilds of rural Northern AZ at the time, my trips to the valley would often include a visit here (mostly due to its proximity to REI around the corner, relatively).   While I do make my way here occasionally, I find it is mostly to go to a movie within their IMAX theater. Outside Scottsdale and Chandler Fashion Squares this is still a decent mall. [Poor MetroCenter...]  I have never had an issue with finding a parking space and they offer Valet at their peak busy hours. On my last trip here I picked up a phone cover and some 6ga channels (\""earrings\""), but of course my main reason was to see a movie at the IMAX."""

I would, without question, recommend Newby's Automotive to a friend. I also appreciated the cute dog in the waiting room. Definitely kept my 1 year old entertained!"
ih7Mo__qChg6M39YHQCfgg,Not satisfied.  We used them to rent a house in fort mill. Told them and wrote on the lease concerns that need to be addressed and fixed. Haven't herd from since we moved in.

This is not the way we're used to conducting business. I hope most realtors are more professional than this. Thanks
SvMBtzXfE-3H5pxoR7VD3w,I've been coming for lunch here for the past 5-6 years. The food is good (tho the general Tao chicken doesn't taste as good as it once did). The service is usually quick at lunch. We order a few dishes to share and they generally start coming out after about 5-10 minutes from ordering. Great if you're in a hurry during lunch. Lunch specials come with a hot drink.

GVyKIZ_0w4xi8Xz09OHI7g,"Visited Zappys auto wash in Chardon Ohio on June 18th at 1 pm.  mentioned to the guys working that I couldn't get my antenna off my truck, they said it wasn't a problem and that they'd get it for me! They couldn't get it by hand so they got a wrench from the office and got it off. The young man didn't mention that he scratched a half circle into my brand new truck. As soon as I got out of the wash to put it back on I noticed the very prominent scratch and filled out an incident report and the man apologized. The company didn't call me or email me back so I went back up to the Chardon location and was told the manager jumps to different locations and to try the Concord office. I went there and was bombarded by many workers at a time! All I did was ask for Aj Zappitelli and explained why and I got kicked off the property and they threatened to call 911 on me said to have my attorney call theirs and more! I have been a customer and have had my taxes done there for over 5 years! They were so rude and didn't care at all to talk to me about what happened. My boyfriend called to talk to them about it and they laughed saying their guys don't take antenna off and I'm on my own with it. Worst experience and left crying with my three year old on my hip. They just lost mine and my families business."
TFXI1fbhrs_kHU-jTKRYCQ,"I have been here for few times with my family members, we always ordered the <dish>Spicy fish</dish> with some side dishes. If you are looking for spicy food or want to try sometime new, I do recommend you to go there.   Here is why:  Food:    <dish>Spicy fish</dish>, it came with whole fish and fresh, they will cropped it in pieces so can easily absorb all the spicy flavor. At the same time,  you can also order some side dishes (like: seaweed, lotus and etc) to cook with the fish. It is very tasty. Because I always ordered <dish>Spicy fish</dish>, so I'm not sure about other dishes. I believe they also do a great job about it.   Service:   The staffs working there are very nice and friendly. I remembered one time we went there pretty last, close to closing. But they were so nice and didn't give you any attitude, all the staffs were there eating their dinner. At the same time, they also pay attention to us just in case if we needed something. I felt so bad to make them wait for us.( :( )   Price:  I think the price is not that expensive, pretty reasonable. They have different fishes for different prices. Also, you need to pay for the side dishes too, which it makes sense too.  I would say you are looking for $40-$80 for group of 4, also it depends on what you order, and how much you can eat. Overall, it's reasonable price.      Environment:  Personally, I don't think it is a huge place, but I do like the size tho because it is a good size for all the staffs to see everyone. And it is a clean and bright place, you won't feel the stickiness on tables.   Location:  It is very easy to find, if you know where is First Markham Place then you are good.   Overall, I highly recommend to people who want to try something new and like spicy food. Personally, I like it very much.",1

I asked to go look at the back wall (where I later learned housed the regular polish) so that I could see all the colors easily. He said \no, pick from the basket\"". I ended up unknowingly selecting a gel color. Was I told this? No. He just carried on and did my nails. When I called Tina, she said that since the color is already on my nails, there's nothing we can do. \""It's like asking for a refund on a meal you already ate\"", was her analogy. This may be the case if you order a meal, express the fact you are lactose intolerant, are reassured by the waiter that there won't be an issue, only to eat it and get horribly sick. Anyways, she immediately started talking over me and when she asked what I wanted her to do, it ended up being a rhetorical question. She didn't care. I asked for a refund on the gel upgrade, a total of $30. In response, she told me she didn't have time for me and proceeded to hang up on me. So kudos to Tina's for screwing me over!"""

I know many establishments push their staff towards the SWAT (Sell What's Available Today) model, but these guys have it figured out.  If they do not have it, they will find it... If they do not not know about it, they will learn about it, find it, and then call you.  Gun stores are not known for their customer service but I think Olsen is changing that in their industry.

We had it in two courses - on a thin pancake with onions and hoisin sauce and then in a lettuce wrap.   <restaurant>Congee Queen</restaurant> has been a great place in the area and Asian Legend elevates the Chinese food offerings. Prices very reasonable - 5 adults, 2 kids $130 plus tax - with plenty of left overs.",1
iD9AS26OSOq2T-W4ihAjEg,"My husband and I used a Living Social deal for $29 each for an hr massage. The outside looked like a typical strip mall store, but once inside I was pleasantly surprised when we were greeted by name and given some fruit infused water.   After filling out a short form, we toured the facility and saw all of the services (but the place was empty!)  I wish that we were asked if we would prefer male or female therapists, because I dId request a slight change, but they were both fine with it.  My massage focused on my lower back since I have pain from a degenerative disc. My therapist spent the entire Hour making me feel great. He knew exactly what I needed and gave the perfect amount of pressure.   I would definitely go back with a other similar deal."
UrhPr4uPoqKrYVANaroqgg,"I can't tell you how many times I've donated unintentionally to this place from them over charging me on the side of potatoes, by charging me an extra $1 for <dish>fiesta potatoes</dish>. A side of potatoes is 50 cents, and <dish>fiesta potatoes with sour cream and cheese</dish> is $1.49. These people continue to over charge by registering it as <dish>fiesta potatoes</dish> and then removing the sour cream and cheese, but I am still getting charged $1.49 instead of 50 cents. My husband likes their potatoes so I end up donating them a dollar from their stupidity about 10 times a month! I'm not even exaggerating either, we frequent this location quite often. Today took the cake when it comes to common sense. They charged me once again for <dish>fiesta potatoes</dish> without removing sour cream and cheese, I said that is fine leave it and add a side of potatoes. So I end up paying $2 for one 50 cent side of potatoes! Where is the <dish>fiesta potatoes</dish> you also charged me for? I said leave it, not as in leave it out of my bag but charge me for it.",1

Ici vous trouverez principalement de l'habillement ainsi que quelques sac et chaussures.   Le choix est vraiment sympa que ce soit en modèle ou en couleurs différentes. J'ai déjà bien dépensé ici car j'ai acheté des chaussures inter saison pour éviter de porter les grosses boots, j'ai aussi acheté les bonnes grosses chaussettes d'hiver. Pour l'instant je suis très satisfait de mes achats et je pense que je vais y retourner sous peu car c'est un bon endroit pour faire un beau cadeau pour les parents pour mon retour en France."
FiqzCoSL7Zh08htOlXXn7A,"AWFUL..I should've read the reviews here first but I regretfully didn't make an appointment at my usual nail place and this is right down the street from where I live so I figured I'd give it a shot. I will not be back.  I came in to get a simple acrylic fill-in (plus repair/new tip on a broken nail) 30 minutes before they closed. I got Kathy (Cathy?) and she clearly does not like her job or want to be there. She obviously just wanted to hurry through her job so she could leave because she completely ignored the photo i showed her of how i wanted them to be shaped and seemed to be annoyed when I kindly showed her the photo again. She also seemed to conveniently forget that my very obviously broken nail needed a new tip applied because after all, that would require an extra 5 minutes of her time doing her job.   What I walked away with looked to be the work of either a student or a nail tech who just got out of nail school. Thick (underneath AND on top) and rough, incomplete surface filing that clearly showed through the polish. It was quite clear to me that she could not be bothered and clearly had somewhere else she'd rather be which made me feel like I dare not say anything, yet I am a paying customer. She didn't even say good-bye or thank you as soon as she was done polishing - she just got up, grabbed her kid and her purse, and left.  Perhaps my biggest regret is that I paid before the polishing was done, which means I also TIPPED before seeing the final product which I will never do again. Also, the 3 other techs that were in there with no customers when I left didn't even say goodbye to me, either.   I went to Jeniza's on my lunch today and was able to get my nails properly filed, shaped and re-polished which makes me feel better, except that I had to pay even more money when NS should've gotten it right the first time.   Like many others have said here in their reviews, I will not be coming back to NS Nails."
inYydawfdLVmcdu6wcKSjg,"* UPDATE * I went to another dentist. I do not need even a fraction of the dental work that \Happy\"" Dental said i needed. This place is obviously trying to get money out of people. I was in and out of the dentist in one hour NOT FOUR!!! Seriously do not not waste your time or money going to this place. You will regret it!   I am giving this place a star because the staff was very friendly. However, I left there angry and frustrated.  After being there for over three hours. Most of which was spent sitting in a dentist chair in a freezing room and watching tv while waiting. And waiting. And waiting. After sitting through, what I consider to be the most painful teeth xrays I've ever had, I was given a $2000 dental plan. I've never needed anything more than a filling in my life! But okay. I made the appointment for an exam and a cleaning. After three hours I left there without a cleaning because they didn't have time! WHAT?!? Needless to say i won't be back. Unless you're looking for a place to waste your time and money don't go here."""

In the end, you Premier Coach did an amazing job on the body work.  It looks beautiful and I am very pleased with the workmanship.  Its actually \prettier\"" now then before it was damaged.....until I opened the doors.  Do you offer upholstery detailing?   If the upholstery detail is as as beautiful as the exterior detail I would definitely use your services. Amazing job.  In the end all turned out well.

Once again, Thank you Carl, Kyle and Cindy."""
xsRufP3c3AQv_FUdMN1hGA,"Great service in a little family owned shop. I've bought a 9mm from them last year and have since retured to use their FFL transfer. In both cases I received fantastic service. They didn't waste any time on sending the FFL out. I walked in the store, told them what I needed, and they literally sent their FFL to the seller right then and there. There was no waiting 2 days for them to 'get around to it.' The prices were all very comtetative. On the majority of guns you'll find the same price or lower when comparing them to Cabelas (for example). Plus you don't have to stand in the huge gun checkout line where one poor frazzled clerk is processing all the 4473 forms. They only charge $20 for FFL transfer when a lot of other places charge $25. Support your local family owned gun store. Especially when they don't suck!"

They were willing to make adjustments to the standard offering for me.  The Sunday New York Times was available!  We can't get it delivered or find it easily in our little hick town.  Very cozy and comfortable.  But they specifically ask for NO BIG GROUPS because its a very tiny kitchen.  http://www.roxburytavern.com  If you've seen \I Like Killing Flies\"" -- documentary about a NY restaurant -- this is like a rural Wisconsin version with a lot more Midwest hospitality and less wacky on the menu.

You see, I'm a recent transplant from NY and I'm a bit of a sceptic when it comes to food out here.  I had gotten home late, wasn't thrilled with anything in the house, and didn't feel like going out again, so I decided on take-out.  I had been getting take out menus left on my door for months, so I decided to give it a shot.  They have a very large delivery area.  When I called, as soon as I told them it would be for delivery, they warned me that it may be an hour or so before it got to me.  That actually fit in well to my plans so I still went for it.  I ordered <dish>Mongolian Beef</dish>, <dish>Chicken and Broccoli</dish> and <dish>Sweet and Sour Chicken</dish>.  Everything was absolutely dee-lish!  He even threw in 2 <dish>eggrolls</dish>!  They gave me plenty of sauces and <dish>fortune cookies</dish> (sometimes they're a little skimpy on these).  The portions were overflowing from the containers.  Plenty of food for the price.

No high pressure sales, gave me exactly what I wanted at the price that I had found on the web with no hidden fees. Best price for the grade and size of tire I was looking for - 25% cheaper than other places that I had priced in the area.  Customer service was top notch. I was able to watch all of the work being done to my truck as well as the vehicles serviced before me.  I describe it as organized confusion. Everybody had a job and when somebody got behind somebody chipped in.  It was a well oiled machine.  I especially liked the fact that my lug nuts were torqued. They sell tires and wheels.  Don't go in looking for any other car service.  Maybe McDonald's should go back and look at how they used to run the hamburger business.  Stick with your core business -and do it well.

To be honest, I was debating between giving a 3 or a 4 stars because their food didn't \wow\"" me. I decided to give a 3.5/5.  I think it is a pleasant place to have a meal. It is situated in front of a park and they have a patio where you can enjoy the summer breeze. I highly recommend the patio seats as it seems brighter than the interior seats (I didn't go in but it seemed quite dark inside). I also noticed people prefer the patio seats, so if you can, try to get there early. We got there at 6pm and the patio was almost filled up even if it was a Wednesday night.  The service was friendly and fast. In fact, a waiter came to fill up our cups even when the water bottle was on our table already. However, our waitress didn't told us what was the dishes of the day. We had to listen to another waitress telling it to another table in order to figure out what they were.  The menu is quite simple. They have soups, buns, appetizers, hot dishes and desserts. I wouldn't say they have a large selection of items (if I compare it to other Asian/Vietnamese restaurant). But there is plenty of dishes to pick from. I had a hard time picking what I wanted to eat! They also have a cocktail menu!  I settled down for their <dish>pad thai</dish>, as I'm a big pad thai lover. I noticed the little spicy icon next to \""pad thai\"" so I asked our waitress if it was possible to make it not spicy. But she said they can make it less spicy, which I was fine with. My friend went with their <dish>laksa soup</dish>, which also had the spicy icon (but she can eat spicy, so it didn't bother her).  We didn't wait too long before having our dishes. My pad thai came with 4 big crispy shrimps. I don't think I've ever had pad thai with crispy shrimps elsewhere, so I was really excited to try it! There were also pork cutes inside my dish. I'm really glad I went with a less spicy pad thai because the more I ate it, the spicier it became. Their pad thai was more on the sour-side. It was an okay/decent dish but quite pricey I find ($18 before tax and tips). I had a sip of my friend's laksa soup and it wasn't spicy at all. She had to add a lot of Sriracha sauce in her bowl to make it spicy. We both agreed the soup was a bit bland and somehow it tasted a bit like pho broth to me.  Before we left the restaurant, the table next to us' order just arrived. Their beef pho smelled SO good! Next time I go, I would probably try it (although it is more expensive -$14- than the other pho restaurants in Montreal). Their buns, coconut salmon, BBQ ribs and grilled beef also looked delicious from the pictures on Instagram and Yelp.""",1
-Tpo5r3kF_z4iilx8JXhvA,Good food.   Confusing ordering operation when your looking at the menu on the screen it changes to pictures of food.  There is no labeling on what they have on the hot tray.     I would return but will have to check out the menu items before hand.  Food is tasty and fresh.,1

-_g9GzASXWdHTcsRs_bZng,<restaurant>The watering hole</restaurant> is a simply the bar area in Whole Foods. They do a great job of selling craft beer and always have something tasty on tap.  Also a nice selection of wines. Best time to go there is when they do not have events as the staff generally consists of two people who simply are overwhelmed.  They did a poor job in planning this place or staffing it as it is horrible when it is crowded.  Can take close to 30 minutes to get a beer.  Plenty of food options in the store. There is also something odd about drinking in a grocery store.,1

-heQCpfvoVEEgDynXPITRQ,"*Overall, excellent trainers and a good experience for many, just not this case.    It took me some time to decide to write this review, and only after being coaxed by a few friends over the year. I was excited to send my 8 month old Lab pup to Partners for boarding and individual training for 2 weeks during the 4th of July holiday. I'd researched them thoroughly with all good reviews and high recommendations. I met with the staff before the drop off/boarding and had no reservations about it.  Very nice establishment and professional staff.   When I arrived to pick up my dog one day prior to the scheduled day (I'd been advised she was out of food), I was told that she had vomited in her crate with no explanation as to why. I listened carefully as they explained it was difficult to keep her attention, what training had taken place, and that they would like to keep her one more day and take her to their vet. That seemed odd, since I had a very good vet and both of us were in town to care for her. After 2 hours of waiting, I wanted my dog and was told they would bring her out.  My 8 month old pup walked past me, eyes at half mast and obviously lethargic, as if she didn't know me or my 9 yr old son. After a 10 minute review of the training done to help her walk on a leash - she was very obedient to say the least - she was put in the car and I went home and called my vet.  The pup couldn't stay awake, hadn't gotten sick in the hour I had her home (no fever, ever). The vet told me it was possible she'd been drugged, exhibiting the signs of such for a dog this young, who should be vibrant and bouncy even after 3 hours of rest (2 while waiting for the dog and 1 at my house).  The vet said he could do blood work but it would take a few days to get back to confirm. I declined the blood test, and they will no longer recommend this facility to their patients after our experience. When the staff member/trainer called us back to inquire about our pup later that afternoon and see if we were coming for the Saturday follow-up training, I said my vet and I believe she was drugged and for obvious reasons I can't bring her back.  There was no denial, no apology, just a simple, polite, \we hope she feels better.\""  And she did, by the end of the next day. No fever, no vomit, nothing but lethargy and the inability to keep her eyes open.  I know they can work the dogs pretty hard, and this is a very happy, energetic pup (usually) but this was much more than typical fatigue - I work her out every day. The feeling I left with was I'd put my trust in Partners and felt deceived at what appeared to be an attempt to ease compliance or to keep her quiet in the crate. If you proceed, please do so with caution - I wouldn't leave a puppy for boarding."""

-oOKqZbYDt08zaWWyLZNIw,"This is my new favorite Chinese spot here in Phoenix!!! I travel back and forth between the Phoenix area and Northern CA and have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant here in Phoenix and have finally found it!!! The food was wonderfully DELICIOUS and fairly inexpensive with the majority of entrées priced at less than $10 dollars each. We ordered the <dish>sweet-n-sour chicken/pork</dish>, <dish>house fried rice</dish>, and <dish>shrimp w/ broccoli</dish>. There was plenty of meat in the rice including shrimp. There was plenty of shrimp in the broccoli and we were even able to get $2. of beef added to the shrimp w/ broccoli which was also good amount of meat to make our own combo dish. The service was fast as others have reported. The dining space was very limited and not very inviting but the food for me is the best that I've had here in the Phoenix area and is the place to beat for me. At this point I'm willing to make the 20+ minute drive from our place any and every time that I want Chinese food while in Phoenix.  My only con was the lack of ambiance and limited appetizer menu.  Thanks to all those who have posted your opinions to Yelp as the reviews for this place were the driving factor for us trying it out. The rave reviews are much warranted!!",1

-qfZdXO2c-GpvOhr0KmNCg,"We went here because of the MTL a table event. It's a good time to try new restaurant since we already pretty fixated with a few Indian restaurant.  The menu was fixed, 21$ for three courses with naan and rice. I have to admit it's a bargain but it's the point of this event.  As usual, we chose different items to share.  The dessert that came with our main dish was not on the menu nor what we ordered. We asked why, the waiter said they didn't make the other two desserts today but he didn't say anything when we made the order. However, I saw other table having them. So the waiter lied about the desserts. I just don't know why. The <dish>coconut flake cake</dish> we got wasn't even on the actual menu. It seems cheap than other homemade desserts, especially I already had my expectations for the other two traditional dessert.  Nobody like being lied to. I just don't like dishonest business. It was a massive disappointment for me.  The appetizers we had were one <dish>salad</dish> and one <dish>fried veggi</dish>. We liked them both. The sauces were flavourful. The main dish we had was <dish>lamb madras</dish>. Lamb cube in curry and coconut flake & milk. This is another reason why I  hated the dessert, having coconut in my main course and as dessert. Not to mention the lamb was too soft, felt like they were left in the cooking pot forever. The curry sauce was tasty though.  Still holding my grudges.",1

Most of my party made it there before me sms although I had all the tickets, they were very accommodating.   The instructor Kate was AWESOME!!! Very engaging, funny, and kept all of our attention. She definitely made the class more enjoyable. The assistant was so helpful and nice and was there to help n with those \little\"" things we needed.   As we get started there was a bit of confusion for the seats that had already been reserved as opposed to the walk ins they had. None the less they got that resolved and we were ready to start. There os music playing in the background to give the relaxed vibe but I think it was a little bit too loud to hear the instructions clearly. I think the music is a great idea just more in the background to avoid the distraction.   The instructions were perfect and we were all able to follow along. Sometimes she was moving a bit too fast for some especially the ones who may still be on the previous step. So for the first timers I think she could have slowed it down a bit more to avoid all the confusion that the first timers had.   After all the blow drying, putting our own personal touches on our painting, and taking pictures, WE WERE ALL PROUD of our creations. Most people can't believe we actually painted the picture although we thought it wasn't perfect but someone else did. Weird how art works like that sometimes.  I definitely will be back again to get my grandmother out of the house since she loves things like this. It's definitely worth the time and money.

I am not a connoisseur of massages, but I was a sports trainer who used therapeutic massage and I have fortunately been on the receiving end of 30 or so professional massages.  THIS WAS IN THE TOP 3 OR 4 of all time!  I believe they are moving soon, so I will not spend much time on their old location -- it was a medical office - clean, warm and lightly decorated.  Be SURE to verify their address if you think they are still at 1601 Flamingo - they should be moving down the street early in 2014.  My wife and I used a Groupon, so the price was downright CHEAP.  I don't remember the exact regular price, but I was surprised it was so low (especially compared to \spas\"" at the Las Vegas hotels!).    They arranged us on two adjacent tables in a nice room.  Pleasantly dim, good air temperature (pleasantly warm), quiet instrumental music, and comfortable tables.  Pedro applied firm pressure on my request.  I work out hard and have significant  muscle.  Some massages can't get down in there easily, but Pedro succeeded.  The hot stones were a pleasant surprise and felt really good.  Pedro was attentive and frequently asked for feedback on the firmness of pressure, etc.  He understood my directions and followed them well.  There were several things that Pedro did that I haven't seen other LMT's do (some stretching, additional manipulations, particular pressure points) that were very welcome.  I asked for extra attention to my neck and shoulders and received it.  My wife reports she enjoyed her massage also.  The massages were not cut short and probably went a bit over time.  At the end, we both felt GREAT!  Overall, we DEFINITELY plan to make this a MUST GO location every time we are in Vegas!"""

The last few months from March to June 2018 their service has gone down hill and food quality deteriorated.  Takeout orders are constantly wrong and the owner (male) is a very arrogant and unapologetic person.  I ordered take out for my kids and picked it up, then got home and was missing items. Called to complain and asked what will be done to compensate and then he says he will deliver. My entire order was cold and when he delivered not one apology, he just rang my doorbell and handed me bag and left.  Bloody arrogant guy. I will advise to stay away as he is very discourteous and not professional at all as the owner.",1

0Ny6DP19MLNKUqsCqLUSHw,"Everyone at this place was a HUGE help. A friend and I were in need of it when our trailer tire got a hole in it while we were driving. They were already locked up and closed yet they were happy to change our tire on our boat trailer right then.  We were taking our trailer around to their garage and then the axle on the trailer snapped. They helped us move it into one of their parking spots(more like 1 and 1/2) and they let us keep it there until we could get it fixed. It was there 9 days and whenever we came out to work on it, they would always give us a hand if needed and helpful advice. Once we got the trailer back in order we shopped around for tires since we just spent some unexpected money on the axle. They had the best price around. I don't think many other tire places would have done the same for us as they did. THANKS BIG O TIRES on Happy Valley Rd."

We weren't hassled for holding the table the 20 minutes it took everyone to show up, but took care of us with drinks and fries while we waited and checked in on us often throughout our stay.

0PMMhCAz2S5dmcA9mJ3dRg,"Worst <dish>beer</dish> I've ever had and ZERO food, seriously? Let me explain... Amazing location, great ambience and I enjoy all different kinds of beer - From strong IPAs to Belgian ales. I've had two different beer flights here, (have tried them all) and about five different pints. Keep coming back for the ambience, I've been here four or five different occasions with multiple friends. Every single person I've been here with says the exact same thing, the beer is 'watery' - and thats exactly how I feel as well. It's that simple, every single beer taste like it needed to brew longer or whatever one does to make their brew/batch flavorful. It's a waste of $6-20 every-time I go. I keep telling myself it will be different 'next time'. Of all places, you would think that a brewery would know how to brew beer - Time will tell. I'd really like to see another honest/real reviews on here for future customers to get an accurate business summary without wasting time and money. Fix your beer problem and I will give you 5 stars!",1

0cDKiKwsE6NAlfhx-cAWkA,"One of my new favs...  I spent this entire weekend eating out.  The.  Entire. Weekend.  After a very long day of work, coworkers wanted to eat out before they went back to their hotel.  My wife and I hadn't been here yet so we suggested.  I tried to keep this meal as plant-based as possible... And while I couldn't find many, the couple that I did were amazing.  Stellar even.  These are good people and I'm sure that if I asked enough questions and annoyed them enough they would have guided me to something or made something special.  I didn't want to be that guy.  I got the <dish>Brussel Sprouts salad with almonds, bacon, dried blueberries, Manchego cheese</dish>... w/o the bacon and cheese. IDK how they prepped the sprout leaves or what dressing the used on this... but this is honestly 1 of 2 ways that I can now eat brussel sprouts.  I love my veggies but I am like child when it comes to brussel sprouts and I need to be tricked... and tricked they did me.  Seriously bomb as bump.  I also got the <dish>Stinking Rose</dish>: roasted garlic and olive oil, with warm toasted ciabatta.  This was the most velvety deliciousness of garlic I've ever eaten.  The perfect texture, flavor and just... dang.  I really can't explain how well they made garlic taste.  I mean, I really like garlic already but this is just next level stuff.   As for a drink... I got <dish>red wine</dish>. Zin, cuz yaknow, that's my thing right now.  It was fine but I think my food overshadowed it a bit (not complaining).  Vibe... We got there around 5 on a Saturday and it was decently busy.  I got up to go to the restroom an hour later and it was packed, with a wait.  Plan accordingly.  This place is absolutely worth it.  Slightly more upscale  than a few of the places around here but I would feel just fine in jeans here.  They did a fabu job decorating the place.  Service... Extremely decent.  They have only been open a short time and seem to have their act together.  Our service was 4 days into his serving career and did a fine job.  I will warn you to hold on to the stem of your glasses, as he did remove an adult beverage from the table before we were done sucking the booze off of the ice cubes.  That's just learning and I can't knock him too hard for that. I'd go back in a heartbeat and ask for him if I weren't too caught up in myself to remember his name.  Price...  Sit in a classier place, pay classier prices.  Nothing ridiculous and well worth the great food that we had.  You are doing yourself a disservice if you do not check this place out.  And soon.",1

One of our dinners was very, very salty.  Yuk.  We decided to split the <dish>salad with the poached egg </dish>on it -- thought that would be interesting.  It was -- the egg was RAW.  We questioned the waitress about it and she explained that ti was poached. Well, yea, it was, sorta.  But does poached mean there would be uncooked egg white and yolk running over the salad?  A fellow, seemingly \in authority\"" stopped by with the full expectation that we would lavish complements on the establishment.  We also told him about the problem.  No response -- he moved on.    The beer list was minimal and undistinguished and the wine list was extensive.  Both wine and beer were v-e-r-y expensive for an undistinguished  little joint in a strip plaza.  I have never paid $6 for a 12oz bottle of beer before.    So, here's our score ...

Anytime I am there we are greeted and promptly asked if there is anything they can help with. They always have a very good selection of comics for any age, and the knowledge to suggest new reads if your looking for something new. They are also very involved in events in the downtown Glendale area. Ever since we first walked into this store I have felt that I was part of the Drawn to Comics family and have been treated as such since then. If you haven't yet, you need to stop in and meet these wonderful folks and experience this yourself. No need for me and my family to consider going anywhere else."

0qSKZhVC_BHPuKro4QGWJw,"My review is for happy hour.  I kept hearing about this place and thought I would finally make my way in since I live so darn close.   It was a short walk from the escalators for the theater, and it seemed primarily composed of bar type seating.  Nice comfy chairs, elligent decor, and  purse hooks which really make a big difference for us ladies... Or men who enjoy purses.    My first fatal error upon arriving at 4:10 was not realizing happy hour only included drinks until 4pm, and at 5pm small plates could then be ordered. I arrived very hungry.  So since alcohol was all that could be consumed my lightweight self became very inebriated by 5pm.  My favorite <dish>martini</dish> was the blackberry.  Not artificial tasting,  the basil balanced the sweetness,  just a yummy drink.  My second favorite was the peach apple,  but my friend had the <dish>fat Elvis</dish> I believe,  and that was to sweet for me.   With the half off discount most martinis are about 7 to 8 dollars,  and they fill that glass super full. I appreciated the glass was chilled.   They also have reduced cost wine  for happy hour.     Now the small plates for happy hour were definatly small,  and compared to other happy hours I really love like brio or Soho,  they were a bit overpriced.  Most averaging 10 dollars. This is the main reason I'm marking off one star.     The <dish>beef rib</dish> was tender and we'll flavored, but not much meat on the single 9 dollar rib.  It was served with some mash potato puree and a couple roasted veggies.     The <dish>lobster puffs</dish> had no actual peices of lobster more a  puree they piped into the puffs .    The <dish>fried chicken and chedder biscuits</dish> were nice, and the most fillings option.  Tender and crispy,  and I always love a good biscuit.   We also ordered two desserts which were not on the happy hour menu.  The <dish>chocolate souffle with pistachio sauce</dish>: not bad,  but it didn't blow my mind.  The <dish>cheesecake</dish> :huge slice could feed an army,    nice and creamy,  could use more of a sauce or fruit for its size.   Overall the service was attentive, which I appreciated.  The crowd that ate their was more on the 50 plus side,  so we were definitely the odd men out.

0rrq-d9iNL2rrLET61v7jg,"I used to work near by to this particular <restaurant>Laredos</restaurant>, so I visited often. We would order for pick-up for lunch often, have an after-work cocktail every now and then, and occasionally gather larger groups of coworkers together here to celebrate a promotion, say farewell, or congratulate a retirement, etc.   Now the food is pretty typical American-Mexican. If you're looking for super authentic, this is not your place. But if you're looking something quick and easy and yummy, this is a win. I have eaten a lot of Laredo's meals over the years and there's not a single time I can recall having ever been upset, unsatisfied, or disappointed. Likewise, I cannot think of a single time that really made me say WOW either.   They typically have lunch specials everyday which is really nice. They are really fast, too, during the lunch period. I have experienced slower-than-expected service during dinner visits, but at lunch they really seem to have it figured out. Perfect for those of us who don't have a long lunch break from work but still want something hot and delicious.   The bartenders have always been awesome when I have been in. They mix up delicious specialty cocktails and are fun to chat with. They put up with my rowdy work crew with smiles on their faces even when I know we are being loud/needy :)",1

0xyqLvtr0Zbr4G-gML-QmQ,"If you're looking for that ultimate <restaurant>Fleming's</restaurant> experience you've saved up months for - don't bother coming to this location. Please make the drive up to Scottsdale where the standard seems to be a lot higher than here.   It's pretty packed during Happy Hour but because of that, I get the feeling that the servers in the bar and patio area know they're getting shafted with probably lower than expected tips thus, lower customer service. I sat on the patio for dinner and was not expecting to spend my night constantly waving at the server like I was at dim sum - not here of all places.   Food is great and pretty much on par with other locations, but the service here is like nails on a chalkboard. We sat on the patio and if you order anything other than water, don't expect the server to come by and give you another refill. It's best you measure out your sips for the rest of your dinner. In the time it took to get another <dish>beer</dish>, you would have sworn they were self-brewing in the kitchen because that's how long it took. Asked for bread service but it never came, even after our entrees came and we asked a third time. What was pretty irritating was that all the other parties who sat down after us in the same area were getting great service, refills, bread, etc. They were all bigger parties and ordering wine glass after wine, so I had a guess as to why he would baby their tables and not ours. Regardless, never in my wildest dreams did I think that my childhood dream of being invisible would come true, but this server definitely made sure of it. Not as exciting as I thought it would be.   We told the manager what was going on and all he could say was that our server had 7 years of experience and was amazing at what he did. If only I had a manager that could say such amazing things about me while I ignored all my responsibilities at work and watched YouTube all day. The manager offered us free dessert, but it didn't really matter to me especially since I did not come for dessert. I came for the upscale ambiance and opportunity to wow the company I was with.

I brought my 4 year old daughter in for her first eye exam, and she was very nervous but Dr Sandi was able to take her time to get to know my daughter first and asked her some fun questions. My daughter was still nervous but was at ease. Dr Sandi was also very thorough with the ex for myself as well. She never seemed rushed and I felt comfortable knowing exactly how my eyes were when leaving. The front staff was very friendly and accommodating as well. I was a little late but was able to call to let them know my delay, and very friendly about it. Very satisfied!"
11tCrJwtA4XWyCazX5ziXQ,"I've had Humana Mail order pharmacy for several years and have to echo the comments about slow service and unexplained cancellations (with no customer notification), delays due to miscommunication with Dr's office, and delays due to re-repeating the prior authorization process at the last moment, and delays in not noting that refills have already been approved. As noted elsewhere, the problem seems to arise with certain medications which then evidently throws their process into chaos. Routine medications are handled more smoothly in my experience. On the telephone staff are very pleasant, take notes, make internal calls and give assurances which often don't hold up. This year the feds are evidently allowing dispensing of only 30 rather than 90 day supplies of certain meds meaning the hassle is now becomes monthly rather than quarterly. I'll drop Humana as soon as an alternative is identified, even if more expensive. Probably easier to just pick up an Rx from the corner drugstore."

I ordered the <dish>lamb congee sou</dish>p and when it arrived it was nothing like the congee soup I've had at other places. It had lamb bones taking up half the bowl and came with a questionable plate of shredded cabbage like vegetables but it wasn't cabbage. I attempted to eat it but had a hard time swallowing it after 2 spoonfuls. I asked the server if there was anything we could do as I could not stomach my order and I was still hungry. His unsympathetic response that nothing could be done turned me off of ordering anything more off the menu.  I will definitely not be returning and would not recommend this place even to a stranger. If you're in the mood for Asian food and it happens to be late night.. Don't let this spot be an option. Unappetizing and unempathetic hosting.,1

He genuinely cares about his precious furry patients. He did not rush, stayed in the room and answered every question even though we came in for a unscheduled appointment. He found a life threatening condition my Charlie has.... Sent me to a Vet Cardiologist. Stayed late after we received cardiac clearance to move forward with the surgery. That same night he was leaving for a conference out of town but still waited for us. Called me after the surgery just after 9pm to let me know how the surgery went and how my baby was doing. Didn't charge me extra money for pain meds! Saved me a ton of money vs going to a orthopedic vet.... A significant amount of money$$$. He was calling to check on him the 1st post op day when I was picking Charlie up. Then to top it all off when I went back a few weeks later for his shots and he was so gentle and kind to my cat. Actually, rotating the injection sites and baby talking to put my little guy at ease. A little over a month later Charlie is doing fabulous! This is the place to go!

I have a hard time letting anyone else touch my brows because she's that good.  I have very dark, thick brows and she is able to tame them in a way few can - not overly trimmed or plucked - just the right amount to make me feel manicured, put-together, and my very best.  I always have a little spring in my step after seeing her, not only from her work but also from her kind and warm personality.  To put it simply: I HIGHLY RECOMMEND CLAUDIA FOR WAXING. GO NOW!"

Your experience starts with a <dish>basket of crackers</dish> and this <dish>cheese-like spread</dish>. Don't judge it, eat it. You're welcome in advance.

You've got to get a <dish>steak</dish> when you come here, but their <dish>shrimp scampi</dish> is so ridiculously delicious. Solution: get a combo.

I always get the <dish>delmonico</dish> (all steaks come with an onion ring on top) and shrimp scampi, with a <dish>loaded baked potato</dish> and <dish>salad</dish>. The salad is a plate of iceberg lettuce. They bring out a plate of veggies and you can top yours however you want. You're probably thinking, why would I want to get a salad then? Well, it's because they make all their dressings. Stupid good. I go with the blue cheese.  For dessert, warm <dish>apple pie and cinnamon ice cream</dish>. I don't care how full you are. Also of note, half price wine on Mondays. You can also bring in your own wine for a reasonable corkage fee.

Had the <dish>Sea Bass with a side salad</dish>, and <dish>corn polenta</dish>.  The fish was a little over cooked, the salad good, and the polenta was excellent.  All in all, worth another try, since the seafood menu was extensive for the region, and a restaurant of this size.

I will book with her every time for sure because she was a pro.   I can't really speak to the pain because for some reason waxing has never bothered me (I find it *immensely* satisfying!) but I can speak to the thing I value the most out if anyone I am paying for a service and that is confidence of hand, checking in, and respect for my time. Jodie was fast, she asked me often if I was good, she let me check things with mirrors and she asked me about everything before it happened and then again after to make sure it was all as I expected it to be. She made me believe she had done this 10,000 times and that I was dealing with a professional. I like that.   There is nothing I love more than deferring some thinking and some decisions to a person who has done this way more than me... Like I don't know what shape my eyebrows should be, I read zero magazines that might tell me, I work a lot so I don't ever have time to sit around and wonder if I should trim them or if they are arched in the right spot for example. If someone can make me feel comfortable enough that I say \""just make them right for my face\"" and then I leave and think \""these look much better now\"" then they are an A+ winner in my books.  I found all the services I had done fast, mostly painless, and professional. The receptionist is also pretty awesome too, so I'll virtually high five her as well."""

1RIGI6BHiS9sIv-ddgD1cw,"Booked maybe a week or two in advance for my boyfriends' birthday.  My arrival wasn't so great.  The gentleman working at the booth tried to get me and my friends to pay $10  each for parking when we arrived at 5:10 even though it says in our email confirmation that parking's free after 5. I tried explaining but he kept telling me to get someone on the phone to confirm or he won't allow it and he was very rude when he added that I'm blocking up the flow of traffic so to keep going around until I get someone on the phone. I showed him the email after he kept dismissing us. I told him my friends & I will not be paying for parking when it's supposed to be free and if he chooses to give us a ticket, that's on him. He starting cussing at me saying that I must think I'm the manager. His name is Michael and this already started us off on a bad note.   When I got closer to the entrance, I saw 2 security and explained the situation and they laughed at the matter and told us not to worry about him. I guess he has issues like this frequently.   Once inside, we were told we were booked for a different day. I was pretty annoyed at this point because we already had an issue just getting through parking alone. After a bit of going back and forth with the general manager though, he was very accommodating and explained that he didn't want us to miss out on this experience and somehow squeezed us in because there were some no-shows.   Everything was great from then on. The props, the acting, the setting and the storyline had my boyfriend and all my friends really intrigued. We took part in the Bootlegger challenge. Its 14+ and there's some gun props involved but otherwise, it seemed like it could also be a perfectly good family fun game. The actors give out just enough hints without breaking out of character and I was so surprised by how quickly you can make friends with complete strangers just from being given a clue to solve together. We were broken up into smaller groups and in each room, there was a character there to monitor us while staying in character the whole time. it was simply amazing!  It's a bit more expensive than the usual escape rooms I've been to but this one is by far the best!   I give it 4 stars. the 1 star was taken out because of the parking incident and the tech issues from the dates selected (I was very careful to make sure I got the right date but it still came out wrong.. maybe it's because I booked it on my phone?)"

Rooney, they were known as the Pittsburgh Pirates, later, given their own identity and renamed the \Steelers\"" in honor of Pittsburgh's steel industry.   The first thirty-nine years were not kind to Art Rooney and the city of Pittsburgh, the Steelers could never put a winning season together, until, finally in 1972 Chuck Noll guided the team to their first divisional crown and playoff victory. It was on December 31st that perhaps the greatest play in NFL history took place when the \""Immaculate Reception\"" propelled the Steelers to a victory over the Oakland Raiders. Instantly the city became a football town, with the Steelers winning four Super Bowls in six seasons.  No team has more Super Bowl victories (6) than the Steelers. Also, Chuck Noll is the winningest coach with four Super Bowl crowns. Bill Cower and present head coach Mike Tomlin also have Super Bowl victories.   Notable Steelers in the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, Jack Ham, \""Mean\"" Joe Greene, Terry Bradshaw, founder Art \""The Chief\"" Rooney, Chuck Noll, Mike Webster, Dan Rooney, Franco Harris, and many more. Steeler fans want the Hall of Fame to open a Steeler's wing to accommodate all of the players in the hall and future Hall of Famers.

Clean, generally reliable, and most importantly FREE, this is a great alternative, especially if you are not on a tight timetable.

I browsed around the store while she was looking, and I found a BUNCH of cute stuff for nothing over $8. Another thing that I liked was when I looked through the racks, I saw NOTHING stained or torn. You can tell they are very particular when making a purchase. When I went to see how much trade in she would give me for my clothes, it was refreshing to hear $48 when she only took half of the trash bag. I was very happy with my purchases, and I will be back very soon."

1f7AEcZfKF7F4hvehrUqaw,"Unfortunately, I was not taken care of. I placed an order over the phone with a representative who told me one thing and the owner finalizing my purchase told me another. I placed an order over the phone for two <dish>kids meals</dish> and two adult entrées. This location has a recurring promotion that kids eat free after 4 PM on weekdays (not a coupon that you redeem).  Like any savvy consumer, I also went online and purchased a Groupon type certificate. On the phone, I asked the employee if I would be able to use my Groupon at the counter and they said yes. When I got to the location, not only did they forget one of my kids meals, but the owner informed me that I was not able to \use a coupon on top of a coupon\"". First of all, your recurring promotion that kids eat free is not a coupon nor was that disclosed by your previous representative who took the call.To have a customer come in and change the price by essentially doubling it is a little troublesome. Your sign that kids eat free after 4 PM on weekdays also does not have any disclaimer notice about not being able to use other coupons or certificates. If that is your policy, it should be in writing and your employees should be aware as well. Won't come back.""",1
1gBBumY1aO5x4ybRYWRacA,"The food and the setting are wonderful.  Everything else, which is basically the staff, is not.  Sure it's busy in the summer and things can go slowly.  But in the fall, on a quiet morning there should be no excuse for such rude and slow service.  We were informed - with a huff and a rude \we don't open until 11:30.  You have to wait\"" - that seating wasn't open until 11:30 so we opted for the take-out bar.  This was at 11:21.  There were 2 parties of 2 ahead of me and the counter-service girl was so insanely slow that these 2 <dish>coffees</dish>, 2 <dish>juices</dish> and a <dish>nectarine</dish> took her 13 minutes to serve. I know this because by the time she was taking my order, I was informed <occasion>breakfast</occasion> wasn't served after 11:30. I looked at my clock:  11:34.  I told her I had been waiting in line for nearly 15 minutes.  She rolled her eyes and asked someone if we could have one more breakfast.  Now it was his turn to grumble and grudgingly say \""I guess so\"" and then turn to the kitchen and loudly say \""Sorry guys, but we have to do one more breakfast even though it's after 11:30\""  ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?  If your service was at a normal pace - I would have ordered before 11:30.   The second part of my order was a <dish>hot dog</dish>.  I was told they might not be ready.  Sooooooo, you don't serve breakfast at 11:30 but you don't have your hot dogs ready for your lunch? That makes sense.  Finally, we got our food.  But the hot dog was raw and my husband had to take it back.  No apology and then they asked if he wanted his money back or another hot dog.  Then he was told that the hot dogs weren't ready so he can have his money back or nothing.  Fine.  They gave him stale <dish>tortilla chips</dish> that took forever to put into a paper bag.    The food and coffee, when you get it, is delicious.  And to the other reviewer who says you should relax and enjoy the island vibe - well that's all fine and dandy if the island vibe is rude and dismissive.  I would be okay with the slow service if it was at least service with a smile.    It's a family run business and probably doesn't have to rely on service for business as there are only two places to eat on Ward Island.  But will be bringing a picnic next time and skip trying to deal with the incompetent staff""",1
1gYcUlax8XSqiwpePArofg,"This place is a dump. It's on the seedy side of town, and the building is old, the interior just as dull. My room had the \public restroom\"" smell... the musty, wet smell that one associates with urine in public places. I tried the a/c and asked the reception desk about it but didn't get any satisfactory answers... until I figured that it was probably due to the cleaning person washing the bathroom without fragrant detergent... it probably left the humidity in the room.   I also asked the lady at the reception desk about good restaurants in the area. She had no clue, and asked if I was \""looking for the bar scene\"". I gave her a blank stare and asked again for \""high quality restaurants\"". From the suggestion she gave me, I realized that she has probably never stepped outside of a McDonalds-and-Steak-and-Shake lifestyle... I ended up doing the research on my own."""

However what is good to know about this wing place is they always come out good... Not sometimes overcooked or sometimes undercooked or sometimes not enough sauce... Here it's always the same which is good for wing place... Consistency",1

1oNL56rWwMdUDTb_SWKpkg,"Ever get that feeling of being in an enormous place with too much stuff in your face and you're completely overwhelmed?! Well, in this case; it was a pleasurable experience I received from my first step in Ashley for the first time. I was in awe with the beautiful stages of room settings and décor and I wanted just about everything this furniture store had in it and then approached the Brooklyn, New Yorker; the incredible salesman rep: Rocco and pronounced Rock-O, NOT Row-co, so let's get that right, right now! There was something about Rocco that made me gravitate towards him with his knowledge, professionalism and expertise. I truly wanted to hang with this guy because he has the slickest east coast presence, attitude and speech about him. Rocco is beyond 5 stars and he helped me with several ideas and choices to finally narrow down on my entertainment room leather sectional with 4 fully reclining chairs. This couch is so gorgeous and works with both masculinity and rustic charm. Not only has it fit in to my home perfectly, but its an additionally focal feature to this spacious room and it is absolutely comfortable and the price was met with being matched from another online seller.   I am thoroughly happy with my decision to try out Ashley's and as long as Rocco is holding it down out there, I will continue to do business with them. I cannot wait to update my additional major furnishings and with the help from my only go-to guy Rocco!! I decided to write about my review a few weeks after the delivery and use of my sectional and so far I still love it like the first day I seen and reclined in it on the sales floor. Thank you Rocco for being YOU."
1p6qHrapvuKpbZGLT9qskw,"I've been here with friends four times now, and I feel I can write a review. My review is decidedly mixed. In some ways <restaurant>El Patio</restaurant> has excellent Mexican and Mexican inspired food, but in other ways its food disappoints.  Also of note, new ownership begins this week (first week of November, 2015, so both the good and the bad may be subject to change).  On each visit we were seated or told to seat ourselves quickly. Little to no waiting. The place is nice, well lit, and clean. Service was excellent each visit as well, with menus, water, chips with salsa, and drink orders all quickly tended to. The menu is relatively extensive with lots of alternatives, many that are not available or at least are hard to find in Champaign-Urbana.    I've had four different meals and my experience was the same each time.    THE GOOD: the main dishes were excellent.  Flavorful and hot, always very tasty.  I've had the <dish>ceveche</dish>, the <dish>burrito</dish>, the <dish>chile verde</dish>, and <dish>tacos</dish>.  The only one I'd critique was the ceveche. Though delicious, I am not used ceveche as seafood first cooked then marinated in lime juice. Typically the \cooking\"" is done by the marinade, but some of the fish ingredients were clearly cooked first.  That said, even the ceveche was good and flavorful, and I'd consider having it again after I finish working my way through other interesting items on the menu.  The drinks I ordered also fall into the GOOD category.  I am not a fan of the newer style of sweet, frozen concoctions with classic names.  I like my margarita made of lime juice, a good tequila, and triple sec. A lime slice and salt on the rim is fine, but I don't want it frozen.  I want my martini made of quality gin and vermouth.  I don't want either frozen or tasting more like a jolly rancher candy than a cocktail.  And the drinks I had at El Patio did not disappoint.  They used high quality liquors (at least for these drinks) mixed in appropriate proportions (leading me to believe the bartender knew what he was doing), they were served at the appropriate temperatures, and they were reasonably priced.  El Patio does have plenty of fruffy drinks as well, so it's your choice. My compatriots liked their <dish>frozen margaritas</dish> and <dish>appletinis</dish>, so we all were happy.  THE BAD:  My complaints about El Patio are mostly about the items that accompany the main dish. The <dish>chips and salsa</dish> were OK. The chips are not exceptional and don't taste like they were freshly made. They were a little salty to my taste, and they were room temperature. I could not tell if they had been made a lot earlier in the day or if they were from a bag. However, my first real complaint foreshadows the next ones: the salsa is ice cold. Left until the end of the meal it had warmed some and by then had become tasty enough, but served ice cold it had little flavor.  Basically, anything with (hopefully fresh) tomatoes should be served at room temperature as tomatoes lose flavor when cold. You'd think a Mexican restaurant would know this!  Also, I'm guessing they do not make their own salsa; why would it be so cold if they did?  My second complaint was basically the same about the salad and guacamole. Both the guacamole (dip) and the guacamole on the salad were ice cold. This seemed weird to us, especially in the salad. A nice warm entree, warm beans and rice, and relatively warm lettuce and tomato in the salad did not seem to pair well with icy guacamole on top of the lettuce.  Again, it was tasty enough, but it improves if you let it warm up for about twenty or thirty minutes before eating it.  The beans and rice are a middle ground. They were fine. Nothing exceptional about them but nothing wrong with them.  And finally, this store keeps unusual hours. It opens for lunch and then closes until 5pm when it reopens for dinner, making it impossible for those wanting an early lunch, a bite with friends on the way home from work, etc.  I was told the hours will be changing under the new owners, probably staying open all day, but the waitress wasn't yet certain what the hours would be.  Please forgive the length of this review. I thought I should explain my three-star review as being four stars for the main dish and drinks, two stars for the accompaniments, especially the salsa and guacamole. I look forward to trying other menu items (assuming the menu is not changed by the new owner) and hope for improvements in the side dishes as in general I rather like this place.""",1

1u6-Fy87nmWyGlG0VA1jqQ,Absolutely the worst customer service center I have ever dealt with. The associate Sandra was condescending and very rude. As for the other associates. The one supervisor they had trying to look up the transaction didn't even communicate with me that they could not locate the transaction via the date and card number and just walked off. A gentleman by the name of Dave was the only positive experience.   Listening to the conversations employees were having with themselves as well as the way they were treating other customers has definitely put me off from ever shopping here again.

22emEUJINj455l5gnWbDQg,I got financed through my bank. I know how the car sales goes they always say that they can give you the best deal going through their finance company. They never tell you they get kickbacks. Anyways I go down there to buy this Nissan car cash money in hand and a check on its way. The finance guy wanted me to fill out this form I told him I don't need financing through you guys already have my bank financing me there is the money. The guy would not let me buy the car because he wanted to find a better deal for me I told him no thank you I'm good with the bank that I have. His name is Eric the financial guy. If this is a family owned business you need to fire Eric for not being honest with people. Needless to say I did not buy the vehicle from Coulter Nissan instead I'm buying it from Avondale Nissan and spending 2500 more on a new car rather than an old one. I do have to point out Luke the sales person I was talking to was honest too bad I didn't buy from him.

288uyG-jORlPnGhn3fMlfA,"The only thing wrong with this club is the owner and the management. I got free VIP passes (Not good on Fridays or Saturdays? What does VIP stand for exactly - Very Insignificant Patron?). They make you call a day ahead and give your credit card number and threaten that if you don't show up a minimum of 30 minutes before show time, they will charge your card the full amount. Then, you arrive at the show and, no matter how much food and drinks you order, they will not give you a glass of tap water. Bottled water only. This is a rip-off and it's also not environmentally friendly.   To top it off - while watching the show, a staff member came over and told us to keep it down or he'd kick us out - when it was clearly the group of eight obnoxious people sitting in front of us who were heckling the comedian - not my date and I who were equally annoyed with those people and just trying to enjoy the show ourselves.    The management of this place really disgusts me. Now, I only go when I get free passes and refuse to buy anything inside. It's unfortunate because the comedians themselves are always very funny, servers are generally nice and the food is decent. I really wish the management would change their tune. They make going to a comedy club miserable - and who would have thought that was possible? I wish this was still the old Yuk Yuk's. I really prefer their management - even if the prices are higher."

Andrea is just an amazing person and you'll look forward to your appointments with her. I've definitely become friends with her over the years, and I travel all the way back from Los Angeles to see her. I honestly can't say enough good things about her! PRICES/BOOKING: CHEAP! Unlike most places in Las Vegas, Andrea's prices are extremely fair! And she does an amazing job every time. Booking is SO EASY! You just go to her website and book an appointment online. She is ALWAYS on time and very respectful of your time as well.   LOVE ANDREA!!!!!!!"
2EhBiUnUTl_H2s4DXdKCTg,"We were ravenous when we arrived after a morning of wedding dress shopping, and we didn't have much time because we had another appointment after <occasion>lunch</occasion>. Our server was very nice. Among the 4 of us, we had 2 <dish>turkey burgers</dish>, 1 <dish>salmon taco</dish>, and 1 <dish>chicken with brie cream sauce</dish>. The food was good, but nothing spectacular. My turkey burger was rather small, particularly for the size of the bun (even after I pulled off some excess bread). The <dish>tortellini salad</dish> lacked any flavor whatsoever. My sister's <dish>sweet potato fries</dish> were delicious. The service was decent, but we had told our server what time we needed to leave and we waited quite a while for her to give us a check (we were almost late for our appointment). She apologized saying she got stuck on a long phone call. Not sure why a server is taking phone calls at the restaurant (or whether it was even related to work). Either way, it was a decent lunch spot but I wouldn't rush back.",1
2EseSYpIwW6JaA0wUojd4Q,"Dirty restaurant, food okay. We went on a Monday evening so you'd assume they didn't have too busy a day, if there's any excuse. Trash and food pieces all over the floors, tables not cleared and bathrooms had paper towels on the floors. The food was okay (<dish>beer</dish> was flat) but unfortunately the food quality was overshadowed by the dirtiness of the restaurant. There are better local Mexican food places that are cleaner, probably cheaper and better service.",1
2FImjoBv0qvq9NumhcVOyA,"My mother saw a program on tv recommending this restaurant. Went there for <occasion>lunch</occasion> on a Saturday. Quite a lot of people, so it was a good sign. She ordered a <dish>curry chicken with roti</dish>, I ordered <dish>nasi lemak</dish> (coconut flavoured rice with curry). My nasi lemak wasn't too bad although I didn't think it was spicy enough - but, I understand it's hard to gauge customers especially when most are Chinese and I'm for Malaysia, so, I should be able to handle spicier.  What was really disappointing was my mom's curry -- absolutely not spicy at all. I was shocked! Also, the service was not that great. No one came by, not even once, to ask if we'd like more tea or water. They did not come and ask if everything was okay.  Stuff like service and my mom's disappointing curry left me with a bad taste, even though I didn't think the nasi lemak was that bad -- but, I've had better in the GTA.  I don't usually rant like this. I also like to give a place a couple chances, just in case - sorry, not this time.  I was hoping to bring a friend to try this place if it was good -- definitely not!",1

Super disappointed to see frozen chicken strips and onion rings pulled out of boxes in front of me, I guess I'm a snob for freshly made. The burger wasn't much to look at, I normally take pics of my food but it looked kind of sad. The first bite made all of my apprehension about this place disappear. They make a fine damn burger. Onion rings were solid as well. I will be back",1
2GIuCQJ9vfMY7rERB-SkUA,My boyfriend sent me flowers from here and they are the most beautiful flowers I've ever gotten! As they are now on day 4 the roses have bloomed to be as big as my hand! They smell amazing and look amazing. Their customer service was wonderful as well. He called after there deadline for same day delivery and they were still able to accommodate getting the flowers delivered to me that afternoon. I will definitely use them myself in the future but I could not be happier with the beautiful gift I got!
2H3zcRProac_aINzT1Fe6Q,"It feels strange writing a review of a car service shop.  Even the best of places is still going to be at least a little painful of an experience.  What I really like about Sunnyside Honda, though, is the comfortable and convenient waiting room:  A snack area with complimentary cold drinks, fruit, muffins, and other snacks as well as (sometimes) popcorn and/or hot dogs; free wi-fi throughout the area; a flat screen television; aquarium; and two stations for people with laptops.  In addition to the waiting room, it helps that they are open until midnight during the work week.  That all said, I do think they tend to charge a little more at Sunnyside Honda than other places for the same services, and I am getting tired of the all-to-familiar \We did this, but now we found this, which we can fix for $X more.\""  Always with the add-ons."""
2HHngNRl1QxDtYRQBfG6Uw,"This place is next to chucky cheese.  I was at Chucky cheese for a birthday party, but didn't want to eat there.  So ended up here.  It was a Saturday afternoon. Not busy at all.. maybe due to being a long weekend. Atmosphere is nice.  Bathrooms very clean and smelled great!! Cups and plates don't smell like soap.  I ordered the <dish>Sashimi lunch</dish> (10pc raw for $12.98)  salmon was good!! the rest was ok, not bad. <dish>Miso soup</dish> was good, <dish>rice</dish> was hot.  Service is good.  I don't anything to complain about... except as mention in other reviews.. the portion is small.  The price should reflect the location.. i can see this place having these prices downtown (bay/bloor).  But its at Sheppard Ave.. attached to a mall and next to chucky cheese.  So..  4.5 stars for quality of food ! 4 starts for cleanliness and atmosphere, and service. 3.5 for value for your moneys worth.  The Plus side is  , if you want good tasting sushi, and you just got paid,   You don't have to drive all the way downtown, and find parking to get good sushi !!!",1

2KNH2fCFd3bB8787Tlo6vw,"Bottom line: Siena Animal Hospital would not sell me a bag of dog food they had in stock, even though I have a current prescription from another local vet who doesn't stock my dog's food.   Detail: I was in an unprecedented bind because my pup's routine auto-shipment of his prescription food was lost in transit, leaving us with the urgent task of needing to purchase his food locally this morning while a new shipment is being sent. Unfortunately my dog has allergies and this is the only food that works for him.   Another local animal hospital just down the street was so friendly and willing to sell me the food, but it turned out they didn't have the formula I needed. Siena had the formula I needed but refused to sell to me unless I brought him in for an examination. They would not honor my vet's prescription. Well I was also trying to juggle work meetings and driving around to find his food all before his next meal time, and didn't have time to go home and fetch him and bring him in for an exam and still make my work meetings. It's just dog food, and I had a current prescription. It's not like I was trying to buy narcotics. I was so frustrated that I burst into tears right there in their lobby. I couldn't believe how difficult they were making a simple transaction. The lady at the front desk told me to try PetSmart or Petco - which of course I had called several already with no success.   So then I had to go back home and find the time to call even more vets and pet stores to find his food in stock, and then drove to a PetSmart 10 miles away that WOULD honor my vet's prescription. I'm grateful they did, and I'm also grateful for the first vet that was willing to help me and my dog in this bind. But I am not impressed that Siena, only a mile from my home, has a policy that made a difficult situation even more so.   You can be sure that if I ever choose to change vets or recommend a vet, it won't be for Siena. If you make something this minor so difficult, then I can only assume it is reflective of how difficult you make all of your transactions.   And note to self: check his auto shipment status well before I expect it to arrive, because finding local stock is hell."
2KyPvxkqIdJsLUjAsZBBhw,"Highly recommended if you're in Champaign.  This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in at this price range.  NICE ROOMS: - Great sleep-related items including tons of soft pillows, a comforter, and a comfortable couch in addition to the large bed. - TV with more channels than I could watch.  I spent too long in the room watching My Name Is Earl reruns.  :(  There's a DVD player too if you have DVDs. - The kitchen was reasonably large with pots/pans/plates, a fridge, and a dishwasher, everything you need to cook yourself something except the groceries. - Large bathroom and shower area, with a classy sink area out in the main room. - Daily cleaning at a reasonable hour (I've been in other places where they come by at like 9 AM, devastating).  NICE EXTRAS: - Very friendly, available, and helpful staff.  Check-in and check-out was super fast.  I accidentally busted my room key a few times and they replaced it each time without any judgement even though it was pretty much my fault.  Other staff smiled and said hi whenever I walked into the hotel or as I passed them in the hall. - Free continental breakfast and dinner. - Included wireless internet, which was fairly speedy for a hotel connection. - I kept walking by a really nice indoor pool on the way to my room.  It closes pretty early but I would have brought a swimsuit had I known.  There's a small gym too. - Nice set of freebies in the room including the normal shampoo and soap but also stuff like popcorn, coffee, and a daily copy of USA Today (which I just threw away, sad). - Decent location.  THE BAD: - The food's nothing to write home about -- roughly McDonald's quality -- but it could be worse. - The parking can be tight, which is sucky when it gets cold and you need to walk a bit to get inside. - If your visit involves visiting UIUC, there are other hotels that are closer to campus."

Dr. Shalev showed great concerned that  I was in pain and definitely assured me that I would be out of pain by the time I left his office.  Of course nobody wants to get a root canal. Dr. Shalev, made my experience so relaxing, when I was so nervous. First of all, getting that Novacaine shot was unbelievable because it didn't even hurt at all!!! I have never had a doctor give me a shot and not feel it. He was precise and efficient and so friendly. I loved his staff and his dental assistant.   He was so quick with the procedure and I didn't feel much pressure at all considering that it was one of my back top teeth.  I would highly recommend Dr.Shalev to any of my friends. He is compassionate, caring and even checked on me that evening to make sure that I was doing OK. In this day and age, what kind of doctor does that anymore? I am so grateful & better yet,  I had no pain whatsoever!!! AMAZING DOCTOR...Amazing Staff!!! Very pleased!"

2NsEac9xCBI05bo5l4yI7Q,"I had the worst customer experience I have had in a very long time. I was charged for pre-paid gas and I filled the tank on my way to the airport. I was assured by my last Hertz customer service representative that my profile would be changed. When I went to the counter in Las Vegas I may have met the rudest customer service person I have dealt with in a long time. When I asked her what her name was she said \Bridgette, JUST Bridgette\"". When I asked her about reversing the charge for the pre-paid gas she said NO and it was my responsibility to check my profile. This was the rudest customer service person I have met in years. She could have cared less whether I rented a car again from Hertz. She also seemed to be proud of her brashness in-front of the other customer service reps. I am a business owner and very frequent business traveler. If the charge, and especially \""Bridgette\"", is not taken care of I will make it a company mandate to not use Hertz again. As in my business the customer has many options. Today in my staff meeting the \""Bridgette\"" story will be used on how never to treat a customer. The charge was only $30 or so, the cost of having Bridgette as a customer service agent is priceless."""
2OAYkfRzRfeEXi1sZsWTjg,"I had gone to Dental Depot 3 years ago and had a good experience but this time was even better.  After breaking a tooth, I called and they got me in that morning.  I didn't wait more than 10 minutes and I was back in a room.  I saw a different Doctor than last time.  Dr. Diy was the nicest dentist I have gone to since I was a child.  When he was going over my options, he didn't try to talk me into treatment that might not work.  He gave me my options and when I chose, they numbed me up and got started.  I have a sulfa allergy and he was the first dentist to use a different numbing agent because the one they normally use has sulfites in it.  Having a tooth pulled is never a good experience but I felt nothing.  While he was doing it, he kept asking me if I was ok.  After he got done, he explained the instructions to me and said I should schedule another appointment for a check up.  The only place in my mouth that got numb was around the tooth, not the whole side of my face like it usually is.  The numbing wore off within 2 hours and I didn't have any pain.  Waking up this morning, I expected to have a little but I'm not even sore where he gave me the shots, which is a first.  I would highly recommend Dr Diy and will go back again.  I would give more than 5 stars if I could."

I ordered the <dish>oxtail pho</dish> and an <dish>ice coffee</dish> and I was blown away. Their oxtail meat is super tender! I'm pretty sure they sousvide the oxtail, which is why it's red in color but perfectly tender. I also added an egg to my pho which is such a big plus. Broth was really good as well. Their coffee is amazing. I also ordered one Togo I loved it so much.  I ended up coming here 5 days in a row on my vacation. It sounds ridiculous I know. Now since I did come 5 days in a row, I noticed that the consistency changed pretty often.  First day was great, 2nd day broth tasted kind of old. 3rd day broth tasted too new. 4th day was good, 5th day was good. For that I knocked it down to 4 stars...

I guess the meat is lamb? regardless, the portion was huge, and the meat was delicious. There were plenty of fresh vegetables and olives in addition to the iceberg lettuce.

It would be good to take a date there. The bar area is really cool, lots of seats available. Handful of TV's on the wall too.

Initially was disappointed the buffet was unavailable that evening, the assortment in the family style certainly made up for it.    Myself, I am open to any foods and can handle strong spices - the rest of the group are about the opposite.  Despite that, they all enjoyed and each made comments of the variety of flavours.  I found the <dish>Tandori Chicken</dish> to be fairly dry - however that's exactly how the others in the group like their bird so I can't knock it.  The server was new, though he was trading off with another who was really fun.  We definitely enjoyed his sense of humour.  Their menu is huge and we joked w/ the servers about this and they really took it well and we all had some laughs.  The could par it down to 30% though in my opinion.  I know they want to serve lots of variety, however I am a believer in less is more.  Difficult to provide fresh foods on a massive menu w/o causing stress in the kitchen.

The patio is also pet friendly so that's a plus for us!!",1
2gI7dlktBQXPZiuOW-HWvw,"The price was unbelievable, the portions are HUGE and the food was truly great. There's not much more to say than that. I don't give out 5 stars lightly and I was shocked to find food that good at this small, order at the counter, hole-in-the-wall. Try the <dish>orange chicken</dish>, it's the best I've had at anywhere besides a couple of very upscale restaurants. I will absolutely eat here again next time I'm on this side of town.",1
2gUlfNEmqFlugmT-uT1m_w,"Don't get me wrong, I actually like Muji for their look and their aesthetic. I lived in Japan for a couple of years and found they were a good balance between price and functionality. Yes, some of the items were a little pricey but overall I found them similar to other places in Tokyo.  Today I happened to be in the Atrium on Bay and as I'm walking up the escalator I happen on a familiar site. I actually did a double take on seeing the store as it was truly unexpected. But there before me was a Muji so I had to walk in and take a look.  The store is tiny. Really, it's incredibly small especially compared to the ones I've seen in Japan. They only sell a fraction of what you can get over there and then you come to the elephant in the room, the prices.   I won't lie, it's expensive especially for what it is you actually get. I wandered around the store which didn't take much time because of the size, checked out a few things and then turned around and walked out.  Maybe it's growing pains, maybe they'll be able to find that balance between price and value that they got overseas but we'll have to see. But if the crowds in the store are any indication, they might be here for a while.  Now if the rumours are true and we'll be getting a UniQlo sometime this year or next then I'll be really happy."
2gzB4EE7B_QEFWZtJTG4dA,I was on <occasion>lunch</occasion> break and in the shopping center when a friend pointed out she loves the salads here. I had no idea what this place was although i pass by it several times a week. I liked the inside and the patio I can tell it must be crowded at night. I saw they will be having live music too. My <dish>salad</dish> of course was yum and I will be stopping on my home from work more often,1
2hSIeCX2cV-chFcBBXrZZA,"I really really wanted to love this place, but overall, I can only give them an OK rating. I walked in on a Friday at 7:45 PM, service was very lacking, but I understand since they close at 8 and it was a Friday.   Now for the <dish>juice</dish>, I got #1, #2, #6, #10, #16 and #20. Price isn't bad, around $10 per juice, though it was the first juice place that charged sales taxes (for me at least). I have been to many pressed juice places and this place's juices are definitely sweeter than what I am used to. People might love this place for this exact reason, but I don't. #1 is the only juice I think is ok, but it's really too mild, they really need another mix with more of a kick and all greens. All the other juices I tried are just so so, too much fruit juices in the mix for me, way too sweet overall. I couldn't even finish the kitchen sink and the green milk (I know other people love them, they are just not for me) I will stick with my #1.5 and #4 juices at pressed juicery in the future.",1

2j1Iz2ulvqYznXHb2cjVNw,"I am a 2-time customer of Republic West. They replaced the windows and doors in my first house in 2003. As I was quite happy with the first job they did, when I decided to replace the windows and doors in my current house in 2009, I went with Republic West again. This time I paid $14,000 for windows and doors that were supposed to greatly reduce my electric bill. This did not happen and I later discovered why. Many of the windows leaked around the frame, so there was air coming through. I called them and they sent someone who went around and re-caulked all of the windows. I recently discovered that 2 of my windows that were installed beneath scuppers are showing signs of leakage and water damage. When I called RW, I was connected to their warranty \help\"" line, told to leave a message and that I would receive an email within 72 hours. Slightly before the end of the 72-hour time frame, I received an e-mail from the \""Warranty Department\"" stating that the warranty on installation expires after 2 years. After that, they say it is the homeowner's responsibility to \""maintain\"" the windows. It is worth mentioning that there had been no problem with leaks on the original windows which had been in place for 24 years and had required no maintenance. I have also talked to other homeowners in my HOA and asked if they have had problems with leakage around windows under scuppers. They have not.     The bottom line is that this company charges A LOT of money and does sub-standard installation work. Back in 2003, Republic West did good work. That is no longer the case. Get your windows and doors from someplace else."""

It's probably just me but I don't like biting into chicken wings especially at brunch but again that's a personal preference and doesn't affect my five-star rating.",1

The lobby and stairs have kept some of the old charm, but the theaters are relatively new.  Decent screen and sound systems.  Yes, you can also buy wine at the concession stand.  The best thing it has going for it is its location.  You are surrounded by Shaker Square with all of its restaurants for before or after the show."

36qbJUFglkSb4BcblyTl3A,"I had cataract surgery on 5/21 and 6/3 & feel compelled to advise of what to expect.  When entering you'll see a crowd of waiting people (mostly us seniors) & soon find it's run in assembly line fashion, lacking in friendliness.  You'll wait to see 2 technicians (on ea. visit) to test you before seeing the doctor, & before leaving you you'll sit down with the \finance\"" person.  The customer service throughout was mostly lacking & I didn't feel important.  You'll be given a sheet on post-& pre-op instructions, but won't know about this:  ALL surgery is done way out on Pecos Road, & you'll have a hood over your face in surgery.  The O.R. is also assembly line & it made me nervous because nothing was explained & they were short-handed.  Even though I spent time with a lot of employees & doctors, I was not told the DETAILS:  you'll use 3 kinds of eye drops & put them in 12 times daily for 6 weeks & you'll not wear any eye makeup all that time.  You can't read for the 1st few days.  The day after, though you'd love to celebrate your \""new\"" sight, you'll look in the mirror & see many wrinkles, your thin hair, your teeth needing cleaning, & a dirty bathroom.  I was mistakenly sent 22 mi. to the Pecos Rd. location (& given wrong directions) for post-op & wasn't told I could see a doctor once I drove that distance.  I received no call backs on my first 2 calls for info because they insist you use their web page.  Dr. Ravi Reddy told me I would have perfect sight in left eye, & with right eye there's a chance I may still need glasses for driving.  That's true for the left eye but... I now cannot see more than 8 feet in front of me whereas before I needed glasses only for driving & T.V.  So, I really need glasses even when I WALK.  The big questions remains:  why did I have the right eye done & what went wrong?  I had myself seen by 2 other doctors there post op, but still have only been given excuses.  Let this be your judge."""

Although the tattoo artist we were recommended to no longer worked there, Mark worked with us to ensure we had a highly enjoyable experience.  Mark did three of the tattoos (mine included) and Tami did the other two.  I have nothing bad to say about either of them!  Both were personable and professional, working with us to tweak our original drawings numerous times.    Both artists were professional not only on the day of the tattoos, but from day one.  Right when we entered the shop, we were greeted and put at ease to discuss our designs.  The shop is VERY clean, both in appearance and in artist attention.  It was reassuring to watch Mark and Tami scrupulously clean their workspace in between each of our tattoos and I lost count of how many times they changed their gloves.    Both artists answered questions throughout the process with tact and professionalism.  I felt totally at ease and will definitely be going back for a few more pieces."

3IVCHZaMILY5LZMi-tpCJw,"Dave (from Arizona Refrigeration, not AHR) came out and claimed that the heat exchanger was cracked. He didn't use a mirror or in any way try to locate the alleged crack. He didn't even test for CO2, either at the unit or in the house. Instead, he kept saying, \If you make a deal on a new unit today, we can have it installed tomorrow!\"" He called in to the Arizona Refrigeration office to confirm his diagnosis. We were looking at around $7,000.  I thanked Dave and, on the recommendation of a pal of mine, called AHR Mechanical to get a second opinion.  Mike from AHR came out and instead of trying to sell me a new unit, he carefully examined and tested the whole system. He also tested for CO2 not only at the unit but also inside the house. Mike found that there was no leak, which meant that the heat exchanger likely wasn't cracked. He inspected the exchanger and found no cracks. It turned out that all that was wrong was a circuit board. The unit we have is no longer made, and the part isn't stocked--but Mike hunted around and managed to find the part anyway. So instead a bill for $7,000 from Arizona Refrigeration, it was a tiny fraction of that for a circuit board!  It's several years later now and the unit has worked fine ever since. Good lesson to *always* get a second opinion, because there are a lot of unscrupulous and/or incompetent service people out there bumbling around or taking advantage of people.  I realize the name AHR Mechanical is somewhat less than descriptive, but don't let that scare you off. They're able and trustworthy, and that's what you need! My highest recommendation for AHR and Mike!"""
3ItygInw1ZHll29elcRBqQ,"I rarely leave reviews on a place, but this has to be said. I recently joined a gym to workout with my 19 yr old nephew that just moved here from Ohio. I never really worked out before, I am pretty out of shape, and my nephew said he would pick me up and take me with him to the gym.  So for the last 6 weeks we have been going to LA Fitness in Southside. Normally I would have not gone back after the first day, because I am not big into fitness and I work a lot. But My nephew keeps picking me up every morning and taking me to workout. He goes twice a day, one with me he does cardio and I do weights, and he comes back later alone and does his normal routine.   We usually go in the morning when it isn't very crowded, but we have noticed the LA Fitness Personal Trainers staring at us while we work out. I was told it was probably because they are extremely territorial and pushy with their in house cookie cutter training and do not like anyone helping or showing another person how to work out.   Last Friday mid workout we were approached by the Trainer Manager Sam and his backup intimidator guy, to say that my nephew isn't allowed to train people at La Fitness. I stepped in and said he doesn't train anyone. He doesn't even know anyone in this city and only comes here with me, his uncle. I proceeded to speak with the manager who signed us up, and he said he would call into \corporate\"" and look into it. He was nice and professional.   Yesterday, Mid workout. We were approached by the Manager Andrea F. along with the same bouncer/intimidator person they bring for some reason.   Andrea, with the most vile attitude I have ever witnessed in a for profit business, stated that we violated their rules by him \""training\"" me and she was cancelling our memberships and that we were to leave now.   Now, me being absolutely humiliated in front of the people in the gym I will admit. I did say \""are you f***ing kidding me?\""  and I don't see anything wrong with that. I immediately went over to the desk of the person I believe his name is Matt, who signed us up. She has to announce across the room, that \""she is the operational manager and there is nothing he can do about it\"". So at that point I just told Matt we are not done here and I asked for the number to corporate and both the names of Sam H. and the Manager Andrea F.   Normally I would just take my business elsewhere and that would be it. But this is bigger than that. I, like most people aren't super into fitness and it's difficult to get started working out. Much of it is finding the time when working a lot, some is laziness, and a big part for me is just anxiety. Anxiety I get because I don't know what I'm really doing at the gym and that I don't want to go by myself.   Yesterday I was completely humiliated by the most vile and unprofessional manager I have ever encountered. Once I calmed down, I actually contemplated not returning to the gym, as this was an extraordinary horrific experience for us. But I am not going to let these people win. It made me how many other normal people get treated like this here and never return when all they wanted was to get in shape without being humiliated.   I can deal with the disgustingness of the locker rooms, I can deal with all the old naked men walking around buck naked, I can deal with a bunch of the machines constantly being out of order, I can deal with all the swol bros who leave 500lbs of weight on the machines.  But I cannot deal with being flat out disrespected and treated like garbage.   I can see why this particular gym has one of the lowest ratings in the area. it is because you have hired the absolute worst manager in existence. Andrea F."""

The baristas are friendly and it is a lovely, open, bright space with plenty of room to sit and work or chill. What more could you want? :)",1
3KzzG6dw5aN9eIo3cGHaSA,"<restaurant>Steak and shake</restaurant> is perfect for a happy medium between going out to eat and getting fast food.  It has the feel of an old fashioned milk shake restaurant you see on tv.  It is a nice place to spend a meal with someone else, for a low price.  The steak burgers are of an increased quality compared to most fast food burgers, but the prices are not.  Hand dipped milk shakes are almost a must with every meal because they are so delicious.  I ordered the <dish>garlic steak burger combo</dish> with <dish>onion rings</dish> as a second side, and a <dish>western BBQ steak burger</dish> just the sandwich.  For the drink I got the <dish>kit Kat milk shake</dish>.   I strongly recommend trying the <dish>frisco melt</dish>, <dish>mushroom and Swiss</dish>, and every shake on the menu.",1

I have never been disappointed in the service that I have received from Award.   They are able to do Chrome gel polish , hieroglyphic gel polish in any design that you come up with they're able to do it to perfection. I would highly recommend that you give them a chance. I'm extremely picky with my nails and they have my 5 Stars very willingly!"
3M66fDCmYlYkvD0QMsCLVg,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!   PROS- answer the phone to schedule a move and will continue to follow up for the booking.   CONS- overcharge at pick up, charge for wrapping furniture that is supposed to be included in estimate, DAMAGE furniture, LOSE PIECES TO REASSEMBLE FURNITURE, USE DRUNK MOVERS and will not return your call about any complaints!    My sister and I used this company for a cross country move and everything was fine until the movers arrived.  1) they vaguely record the damage on each piece of furniture, which is a problem because when they say your dress is \scratched/damaged\"" that could mean a tiny nick on the right side but it will arrive with an ENTIRELY BROKEN LEG on the left side. They do this do alleviate liability but I'm disgusted by the lack of care.  2) they said all major pieces of furniture would be wrapped at no cost (I asked because I could've wrapped my dining table myself) but was charged over $100 just to wrap that one piece. Do not have them wrap mirrors, the wrapping will cost more than the mirror itself.  3) my furniture was packed by one set of movers and was delivered by another who could not find where the first movers placed the screws to both dressers/mirrors and now my furniture is still dissembled when I paid for door to door service.  4) refused to disassemble and move a chandelier floor lamp which I ultimately just had to leave behind. 5) my movers were drunk and continued to drink while delivering my furniture but I needed the delivery to be completed so there was nothing I could do.   Overall, terrible experience."""
3MZ_H6D9jQFX1tBUIh_Iiw,"Simple and delicious in the heart of Bloor West Village.  It's family owned and managed, so the service is decent.  The menu is what you would expect from any North American Thai restaurant.  What makes this place special is that it's consistently good at a decent price.  I've been there with a small party and I've also booked the entire restaurant for a family party and the food was equally tasty.  I would not drive all the way to Bloor West Village just to eat at <restaurant>Simply Thai</restaurant>.  But, it would definitely be on my top 3 choices if I was already in the neighborhood.",1
3TrY8CpsnvnTTYigx2R4yg,"I love the <dish>red velvet cupcakes</dish>, and the <dish>burnt almond torte</dish> is to die for. I'm not a huge chocolate person, so this dessert hits the spot every time. The white icing is perfectly fluffy and not too sweet. The cream hiding out in several of the layers is light and not too creamy. The smattering of toasted thinly sliced almonds covering the cake is my favorite part! I love going to the downtown location to get individually portioned pieces of burnt almond torte because you get almonds in every single bite!  If you plan on ordering anything in advance, make sure to do it early so you don't miss out! If you're ever wandering around Walnut Street in Shadyside or Market Square downtown, stop in to <restaurant>Prantl's</restaurant>. You won't be disappointed."

It came with:  <dish>Wonton soup</dish> - EXCELLENT, lots of tasty won tons, shrimp, chicken, pork and a varity of crispy fresh veggies.  It could easily be a meal in itself. I really loved it.  <dish>Pupu platter</dish> - YUMMY - very generous portions of egg roll, spare ribs, fried shrimp, beef skewers and crab puffs.   <dish>Egg Fried rice</dish>, <dish>beef w/ brocolli</dish>, <dish>sweet and sour por</dish>k, <dish>orange chicken</dish> and <dish>house lo mein</dish>.   Everything was tasty, fresh, lots of flavor and not greasy. It generously fed 5 adults with lots of leftovers.

3X-jhrbCSMv5hfUS02xdHA,"Had wanted to try this restaurant out since it opened so my wife and I decided to stop in for a late <occasion>lunch</occasion>.  A very pleasant surprise indeed.  The food here is of the New Mexico variety (which we love) and so was being compared to our favorite places in Albuquerque and Santa Fe.  The first test is always the <dish>salsa</dish> and the house <dish>margarita</dish>.  Both were fresh, home made and very tasty.  We ordered a combo that included a <dish>tamale</dish>, an <dish>enchilada</dish>, <dish>shredded beef taco</dish> and <dish>rice and beans</dish>, and an <dish>enchilada plate</dish>, that included a stack of 3 enchiladas with an egg, rice and beans.  The red sauce was definitely New Mexican, properly spiced and delicious.  Even the rice was delicious, which we rarely end up eating at most Mexican restaurants.  All in all Chele, our server,  provided excellent service and recommendations.  Can't wait to visit for happy hour.   The only thing preventing a fifth star was the price of food and drink.  Not used to paying $13 for a house margarita ( although as mentioned they were very good).  With a single margarita and a combo plate for each of us we paid $78 ( including tax and tip). A little more than I expected to pay for lunch.  Even so, we will return and recommend.",1

I asked the woman at the bar if we sat ourselves and she told us to wait for the host. The host finally appears some time later. Only three tables were taken. We were told a 10 minute wait (with at least 10 open tables available). We opted to wait at the bar. My boyfriend ordered a drink. We waited for fifteen minutes in which we still had not been seated. I went to ask the host about the wait and she rudely and childishly replied that she was waiting for tables to get up (which, yes... with ten tables still open). WHAT?!?! We then decided to leave. We will not be going back to try it again. The rude staff and ridiculous wait times were unnecessary and uncalled for given the situation. Shame on them.",1

The burger and prime sandwich  were good and we very enjoy it  however the fries is too salty and dry like potato chip.  Decoration gave me a wow factor therefore I rate environment as 3/5 the main reason I minus two point due to while we were eating there was gentleman was doing video taping the dinning room this make me feel uncomfortable and distracted also that's one the reason I rate service as 1/5. The service is very unprofessional. Food was take more 30 min and the <dish>coffee</dish> and <dish>tea</dish> more than a hour to arrive because the server forgot to place the order.  While we were waiting the food and drink the server is not even check it out for us not even bring us any water instead looking at the tablet until 15 min I need to ask another server to bring us water. After we finish our food the drink still not yet arrive I ask the server where is our coffee and tea. The server finally figure out she didnt place the order and try blame someone else by asking us did we order from other server.   Overall I am very upset the quality of the service. It is very ridiculous and unprofessional. Good food, good decoration but extremely unprofessional service. I am strongly recommend go somewhere else even a food court can provide way better service",1

If you click on their website it takes you to Camelback Clinic at 1025 E Camelback Rd).   I tried calling 4-5 times at various times & days & every time there was NO answer.  I would eventually get an answering machine.  I left messages &  sent them an email (through their website) twice with NO answer from either. WHAT A JOKE!!!!

3fdtp-bzoE4ZgTakkcEBzQ,"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas!  Las Vegas has many nicknames, including Entertainment Capital of the World, The Marriage Capital of the World, Gambling Capital of the World, That Mirage in the Desert, Hot Vegas... and the most famous one which is Sin City -- strip clubs, cabarets, clubbing, 24-hour liquor sales, gambling, easy marriage, easy divorce. Call it whatever you want but whatever you're there for, either as a tourist or as a local, it's a time where you can let lose, enjoy and have fun! Maybe it's the bright lights on the Las Vegas Strip, the 24/7 open casinos, the beautiful (and mediocre) hotels, the plethora of restaurants and food places, the alcohol, the shows, the entertainment... ahh! all crammed in one weekend adventure.  It's one of our favorite places to getaway, after all, hubby and I got married in Las Vegas almost 7 years ago. We've made road trips here as well as flew in. We've stayed at the Bellagio, Luxor, Stratosphere and back then Imperial Palace (which is now replaced by The Linq). Most of the time though we stay at our timeshare resort further down S Las Vegas Blvd. We've enjoyed shows and entertainment acts but have yet to see a performance by a known singer. Dining, now that alone can take you over the top of your budget (if you have one), there are so many good food places to eat! We try to dine outside of the Strip but more than once we'd like to try the more popular spots in town.  When we have more vacay time we will spend one evening on the Strip but the rest of the time we will branch off and drive to other states. Las Vegas will be our home base but we will drive to Utah and Arizona to visit National Parks and other places of interest.   And, poof! just like that, your weekend is done and time to head home... now stop daydreaming and just plan your next getaway to Vegas! Remember, what happens in Vegas no longer stays in Vegas... What happens in Vegas stays in Facebook, IG and Snapchat! :)  Drive Carefully, Come Back Soon!  Review #0845"

Pension Babe: How are you for deep fried milk?  Me: In my culture we have a saying \""if it's not fried it's not good\"".   Oh man. After sharing a 40 piece sushi platter at Osaka Sushi, Pension Babe still seemed pretty hungry. I let her order at these kinds of places. \""Surprise me.\"" She ordered 5 dessert items. Where do these women put it? Seriously.   Verdicts:  Deep fried milk: One of the best things I've had since Krispie Kreme. A nice sugary batter, sweet solid milk cubes. Add more sugar to taste.   Some shaved ice dessert: At first I thought this was a Chinese interpretation of Korean patbingsoo but then I noticed the ice seemed more like a shaved milk ice. Watermelon balls were nice. The milky ice was nice. I think I still like patbingsoo better. No red beans. Yeah. I can't believe I'm saying that. \""A cold dessert with out red bean goop? Why even bother?\""  Mango tapioca pudding: You can't really go wrong with mango anything. Unless you're letting me slice open an actual mango. I get frustrated when holding a knife. Very frustrated. There's a poor outcome, usually.   Mango Egg Something: \""What's this called?\"" \""You know we don't really have a lot of different names for these things.\"" Huh. Sweet baked egg whites with mango hunks? Different. Good.   Rolled Rice Cakes Something: \""This was my favorite breakfast in Hong Kong. I would buy it from a stand on the way to the subway.\"" It bore visual similarity to Korean ddeokbokki but a sweet sesame brown sauce as opposed to a sweet/spicy red sauce. Warm, sweet, nourishing carbs. I can see how this is a morning comfort food.  Seating: Ouch. No conducive to long philosophical chats. Low squat stools. (Erm. I'll leave that one alone.)   Service: Great!  Pro tips: This place fills up quickly on weekends. Before 9 pm forgetaboutit.""",1

I also had the <dish>xiao long bao</dish> ($7). Flavour was decent and there was soup in the dumplings but the meat was kind of dry. I would come back but not often since it is kind of pricey here.

He then called me to let me know that he locked my car, so I had to leave my office again and go unlock my car.

3k9treY8PmsZ42bKmuICgA,"Normally I don't write reviews but I just had to write one to warn fellow foodies out there  I'll use a 5 star rating system 5 star = Excellent, loved it! must go! 4 star = Really enjoy it, give it a try 3 star = Enjoyed it but wasn't the best 2 star = Fair, needs improvement 1 star = I will not return in my lifetime unless a miracle happens   The atmospheres in terms of seats, tables, environment is 2/5 Star. I can see they are trying to save laundry money (they plac8e 2 paper cover on top of their table cloth) but is it really a need? with a resturant interior such as theirs you don't expect that.  1/5 Star for Food I've attached photos of some foods, and if you are a foodie then forget about this place.   Ordered a <dish>beef rib</dish> can let's just say..it looks and taste like the rib took a trip around the Sun, then came back to the beach on Earth to get an additional tan   Ordered a <dish>lobster hand roll</dish> (in the picture you can see a beautiful lobster meat with avocado, fish roe) and ends up to be a piece of tempura battered meat with a hand full of rice that wasn't even properly rolled. Where's the fish roe and avocado? Spoke to the servers and they said that is the lobster hand roll altho \it looks abit different\""....This isn't just a little different. The product isn't even the same thing. If you look at McDonald's Big Mac, even if it looks different in advertisement at least you get the same ingredients.    Service 1/5 Star (continue on from the food story) Afterwards, the servers took it away and empty it in their garbage been and I can hear him talking to the other sever that he doesn't even care about this complaint I just made for faith advertisement. Frankly, I think you had a long day at work. However, stating that when your customer can hear is not professional. There's no feed back given to your kitchen nor bought up to your supervisor or manager.   The whole experience was pretty disappointing. I'll definitely not return to this location, 1/5 overall.""",1

I was there with my 6 year old and she loved it. There is a HUGE jungle gym that she spent a ton of time on with the other kids as there are different ways to climb all over it. She spent a little time with the building blocks as you can build a car with walls different seats all kinds of different things. The options are endless with the building blocks and other building toys.  The water room is probably the best thing and my daughter had the most fun in there. There are tons of things to do in there as water ball towers, playing house washing dishes, making fountains and using balls to see how a vortex works. It is all chlorinated so it is nice  and clean and don't have to work about any illnesses with kids. The art room was also a very cool thing to do before we left to wind down the day.

The online purchasing is easy and setting up a account can save you time and money. All buses have wifi but it's pretty slow and unreliable. Definitely an affordable, relaxed way to get to Milwaukee if driving isn't an option.  Tip: there are different schedules leaving from Kelley's Market and the Chazen/Union. When searching online for a bus that works with your schedule, search by town, not by specific stop"

Because I have mostly hard floors in my home, I decided to purchase a very reasonably priced canister vac. The owner explained to me all the pros and cons of different functions and recommended the one that would fit my needs and accomplish what I was trying to do. My current upright was not made to work on hard floors. Glad I went in and can't wait to try my new vacuum! PS - I did check online and it was the lowest price!"

Not only were the employees bland and inattentive, they failed to let any of my group know they were out of multiple items. They were out of mild salsa and guacamole. When I asked, the employee just stared at me until finally telling me they were out. I asked if they would be making more, they said no, and then somehow more mild appeared after I had half way finished my food. I got barbacoa and chicken in my bowl, the entire portion of beef I was served was all fat and I had to spit it out. I got a water cup, and hair came out with the ice into my cup. I've never been so disgusted by a chipotle before. I had been looking forward to this all day and this just ruined my whole night.

44pzzXXYBtbC0QxHFosagw,"Eyebrows - yes. Waxing -NEVER again. I needed a face wax. She first put wax all over my right cheek, covered it with cloth, and said \okay this is going to hurt.\"" Well, of course it is since you don't know the first thing about waxing. She's the worst for waxing - made me look like someone had punched me in the face and in fact, the blood vessels under my eye skin tore so it looked like I had two black eyes. When my hair grew back, it was rough and thicker. I went to a different salon to get rid of it again and the lady asked me if I had waxed on my own. Well if it looks like it then this place is no where near professional."""
45rWYQPlQ4x5cFU0uuRKug,This place is so small but it's busy which I think is great for a family run business! The portions are huge! I ordered a c<dish>hicken Greek salad</dish> and there was enough for two meals. My husband ordered <dish>fish and chips</dish>. The fish was large despite only being one piece and there were a tonne of fries. I would definitely go back!,1

Any time I am working or driving through Phoenix, I make sure to stop here at this location and get my fill of hot, spicy, amazing New Mexican food! I return to Phoenix in March, for work, and you can bet that I will make a few visits to <dish>Los Dos Molinos</dish> for their awesome food!",1
487ZwV1pjttfx_kdqtIl3Q,"<restaurant>ChuChai</restaurant> does it right. It's obvious from the fact that it's one of the few vegan restaurants that have survived St. Dennis over the past few years. Most of the other establishments have disappeared far from the memories of picky eaters.  It's also one of the few Asian vegetarian restaurants that aren't weird, kooky or too \out there\"" for the carnivores. It's clean, classy and sticks with a traditional menu that's meant to be simple yet impressive.   Took my Chinese mom and aunt, who were both extremely skeptical, after a visit to Aux Vivres earlier that week. The weren't interested in trying another vegan restaurant and questioning the ingredients. Yet within the first few bites, they were blown away by the <dish>salted 'fish' fried rice</dish>, which was made with glutinous rice. They also loved my <dish>Panang 'beef' curry</dish>, with it's delicious red coconut sauce. The <dish>spring rolls</dish> were outstanding too, and filled with fresh vegetables.   Everything was just perfectly flavoured. ChuChai will always be one of my Montreal favourites.  MUST TRY: I won't say too much, but the five-flavoured finger food is a fun treat!  SUMMER: Have a cocktail on the terrace after shopping on the strip.""",1

Highly recommend these restaurants, no real bad food here",1

4CsaeCbJeQ3A6y5knN6W9g,"I came here with two friends for a girls weekend. We chose Aston MonteLago because we got a great deal on Groupon, but it was not worth it.  We checked in late and the front desk lady was not the most friendly. Arriving in our room the temperature was at 77 degrees (in JULY, in LAS VEGAS!). Long story short, after two visits from maintenance we were told the AC was broken. The girl we were working with during the problem was very nice, but we still had to fight for some compensation.  We later called groupon for a refund. They called the hotel and even they the girl said yes they approved a refund, groupon was being told otherwise and would not issue it. The AC in our room was not working, really, why so much trouble?  Aside from the AC, staying at the \resort\"" you are charged $25 per day for resort fees. There were not enough towels in the room for us (3 in the room, only 2 pool towels) so we asked the front desk but they were all out. No towels at the pool area either, and the pool was not clean. There was a good amount of debris in the pool, and build up along the tile. The man monitoring the pool yelled at everyone in the pool twice while we were there. Honestly, yelled! There is also no alcohol or food allowed in the pool area, and there is no bar or place to buy food while at it.  Aside from the AC being out our stay was overall okay, the room we stayed in was nice, but I would not classify this place as a resort--ever. It was just a normal hotel. Also, we did like that it was quiet for the most part and away from all the action of the strip.  Definitely will not be returning to the hotel, or recommending it."""
4DVqziHGABcYUUw_E36c5g,"The best part: I love their attention to Ohio's lakes and streams.  That is specific to our area and should be part of a patron's education.  Since there are a lot of children who go here, I am glad that it is included.  The worst part: It looks exactly how you would expect an aquarium to look if it was shoved into an old warehouse. Also its a little expensive for what you get. I worry that they will not last in this economy with their prices."
4EcY5S3Ph-jdl5IITHiw6Q,"I had vision problem (seeing bright light pattern for several minutes) and my wife suggested (grins) that I see an eye doctor immediately to make sure there was a serious issue with my eye.   Called Paradise Valley Eye Care ( prior exam there several years ago) - explained the issue and she said we will get you in - can you come now.     This office worked me in a busy scheduled appointment queue and Dr Rios and staff still managed to take the time to really investigate and check the health of my eyes.  I was very impressed and appreciative.  The staff is happy, accomodating, all smiles and efficient.  A rare business/medical service that does have the priority of health care over just selling eyewear.     Highly recommended."

Their <dish>sandwiches</dish> are great. Drink selection is great too...beyond the usual fountain drinks, they have two kinds of lemonade and four kinds of tea. Great place for a quick <occasion>lunch</occasion>.",1
4F_7Ihf9FBXCW6PUllXptA,"Great fields and has the feel of an actual baseball stadium. I don't mind paying the $3 fees to keep those unwanted in the neighborhood from the fields. Although in a bad part of town, it is a great experience for those wanting to hit in the cages, enjoy a baseball or softball game, and for those who decide to play. The fees are a little high to play in leagues but well worth it with hired umpires and teams that are competitive. Tuesday mornings are becoming dead in terms of number of teams so I'd recommend joining a Saturday night or another weekend team. Great staff and will work with you to meet your experience needs. I am thoroughly impressed with Big League Dreams as everyone who plays softball or soccer should stop by this place. Even the soccer facility is amazing, a must-see."

My hair feels & looks healthy thanks to Mayra's great styling skills, she definitely knows what she is doing.

4H_MjEd3amnThjyVCSTcUQ,"We were excited to try a new sandwich shop in the area and figured <restaurant>PotBelly</restaurant> was a great choice; boy, was I wrong. The staff was completely unorganized when I was ordering so the whole \welcoming factor\"" was out the door. I had to repeat our sandwiches 3 times and my medium soup twice. The vegetable selection is slim and they have one seasoning: Italian. Now on to the sandwich(es).. gross. The turkey was a darker brown color and the roast beef was almost white, both disgusting. I ate 3 bites. The one star is for the bread. Try Madeline's next door, or which which around the corner.""",1

Couches looked good as new, even after drying, however the smell, I'm embarrassed to say from my dogs, was back after the couch dried. I would still recommend them, based on the technicians customer service skills, the outward appearance of the couches & the clean up. Some stuff can't be helped."

Every other place I called around to told me lies and said the whole thing was one piece and they wanted anywhere from $70-$95 to replace the glass. Not only did Smart Fix save me a bunch of money in repairs, but I can now trade in my old iphone for a much higher price when I decide to buy the iphone 5. They have a life time customer out of me!"

I am always on a quest for a great facial in Las Vegas! I signed  up for a basic $70 dollar facial.The facialist told me  beforehand  that I was just getting a basic cleanse and suggested I get brightening facial which was $105. I decided to try it and I was not impressed. My extractions consisted of her just rubbing a metal tool across my T-Zone.This did nothing to get rid of my black heads!IThe facialist just put  on different treatments  and waited. I am used to getting a scalp massage, a hand massage or maybe the option of a foot softening treatment.She did rub my shoulders one time for about 5 minutes.I was really dissapointed. After the facial I asked the receptionist if a scalp massage and or foot massage was extra.She said she never heard of any type of massage being included in a facial.I am used to that being included in the massage or at least the option of choosing to pay extra to add on treatments or some massage  to the facial . Not impressive!!"

4e3pf8FEDVp_xA3_qwTENg,"I have to interrupt my chain of wedding related reviews for this one... I've always been a huge supporter of animal rescue organizations, and while I rescued Minnie from a small rescue site seven years ago, I've supported the Humane Society through the years with monetary donations as much as possible.  But yesterday, I did something different...  I started my day (just like Melissa H) by rolling over to look into Minnie's eyes and be reminded how lucky I am to have an incredible dog that has become my family... After our morning walk and breakfast, I teamed up with a group of friends and we made the trek out to Dobbins Road and 19th Avenue to volunteer at the Humane Society.  I had no idea what to expect and I hadn't seen the reviews that came before mine, but I was extremely impressed at the size, cleanliness, and friendly staff at this fabulous facility.  During our three hours on-site, Kathy Chumley gave us a tour of the building,  told us about the history of society, and educated us on how they operate, the animals they care for, the staff they employ, the volunteers that help, etc... We saw the cutest dogs, cats, bunnies, and horses and we helped with feeding the horses, petting the cats and bunnies (I guess this helps socialize them), and putting leashes together too.  If and when I adopt another animal, the Humane Society is where I'll go to do it... and I highly suggest checking this place out if you're looking to add to your family as well."

Except for the 2-3 times she jabbed her elbow straight into my spinous process (spine).  I informed the cashier of my bad experience and he still charged me. I am not trying to get out of paying for a decent massage but this was not.

4gwh0q7JsdzHIm_pdYUlZg,"The difficult thing about rating <restaurant>ShinBay</restaurant> 5 stars is that it makes me question my previous reviews and my own desire to go places with a 5 star rating, when perhaps 4 is the benchmark of truly awesome.  Let's face it, 5 stars should be an unforgettable experience that few places could hope to achieve and ShinBay is just that.  The other thing that makes me know it was that incredible is when I think about what it cost vs. what we received I feel it was a bargain.  My husband and I actually stumbled upon ShinBay several years ago in Ahwatukee.   It was the first place I ever went where I put my dinner in the hands of chef and just said go there.  I ate things that I still to this day have no idea about as at the time it was just the chef and his wife.  He didn't say and she mostly showed me pictures when I asked.  We have never forgotten though how incredible it was and have been waiting for the chef to find a new home.   For various reasons we didn't make it in for what I am guessing is a year since its opening.  It was a bit of shock to see additional chefs, one of whom was a favorite sushi chef from another restaurant.  There were also servers and a host, all things you didn't see before.    One comment my husband made about the space was the amount there was between diners allowed for more focus on the food and not other patrons.   There is no questions that the food deserves all of your attention.    We ordered the $125 dinner which was 7 courses at all.  It started with <dish>halibut sashimi</dish> which I can't really explain other than it melted in your mouth and was incredible; then there were 6 different tastes all completely different and each a work of art; a <dish>mushroom and clam soup</dish>; a massive <dish>tiger shrimp</dish>; a do it yourself poaching adventure with scallops, blue shrimp, and uni; two <dish>nigiri</dish> courses where each piece was treated to master craftsmanship; and an exceptionally light <dish>custard with dark syrup and fruit</dish>.  That is a very short listing that only tells you the idea of courses because there is no way for me to describe what we had with any amount of justice.  Also, the nature of the food is that it will change with season and time.  One thing I am of sure of though, it was a true 5 star moment.",1

I initially started going because it was right down the streer, but mow even if I move I would still come here. I initally went to The Birthday Suit but this place is way better.  The prices are comparable to other places. I think I pay $49 for a lash fill (they take a $20 deposit when you make the appointment then the rest after service). I think it's the same for a full brazilian wax.  I see Andrea for my lashes and Shaina for waxing. They are both the perfect mix of professional and personable. But to be honest, everyone here is great. Starting at the front desk, my entire experience from start to finish makes me feel at home.  My only suggestions to clients of lashes is to bring headphones, because the music selection is downright bizarre. Every few songs is something recognizable, but most of the songs are just.... strange. I don't really know how else to describe it.  That being said, I still give this place 5 stars. The fact that the only thing I can find to complain about is the music should speak volumes. I cannot recommend this place enough!"

We also split a great <dish>salad</dish> with a well cooked <dish>Ahi steak</dish> and had the <dish>bruschetta</dish> as well. The whole menu was interesting and we'll definitely be back.  The real surprise was the beer selection. Wow. I had a tough time choosing, and then the waitress told me about the special and it sounded so good I couldn't pass it up. It was an <dish>agave wheat beer</dish> from Breckenridge and it was very tasty.   Great little neighborhood place and we'll definitely be back. Hope it sticks around as the spot has had poor luck with restaurants.",1

Even if you pay the standard shipping it comes quickly!  For reference I am 5'5\, 145lbs, 28\"" waist and 36\"" hip with a big booty!  I always order large because of my bigger hips and they fit perfectly! My favorite swimsuit that they have or the highway waisted bottoms with the triangle top! I've seen so many of these styles all over, however, this is definitely the best price!!"""

4tjKsIaBXCDUP9PL82Vu_A,"Heaven! That's where it feels like you've gone after having a Brandied Pear and Marshmallow Melt body treatment ($135). It's a seasonal treatment, so you'll have to look out for it during the winter time. First, your technician will scrub you down from neck to toe with a pear-infused brandy and sea salt scrub. Once you are super smooth, you will rinse off in an in-room shower. Then you will get a specialized massaged while an amazing smelling marshmallow shea butter is applied.  I would give this a full 5 star review if I hadn't been to some of the other Elizabeth Arden Red Door spas. Although the Biltmore location is very clean and relaxing, once you have your treatment that's kind of it. There are no jacuzzis, saunas, lap pools or any of the things I would typically think of when I think of Red Door spas. If you aren't super interested in anything other than the service you're getting, I would 100% recommend the Biltmore location. However, if you are looking for a full day spa experience, I would suggest making the drive to the Wigwam location."
4uecM2phnKELiEJ8GN9mRw,"This place is so cute! And so huge!! I came in looking for tea cups, and boy did I find the mother load...the only thing was that the majority of cups came in dish sets, so I only walked out with two cups that were not apart of anything. But, either way, their dish/tea set selection was incredible. This place reminded me more of an antique store than a thrift shop. The prices were a little more than thrift shop prices normally are, but definitely less than an antique shop. They had quite a big selection of furniture, and good quality too. They had tons of clothes, but I honestly didn't look through those. There are so many things to see, it's impossible to see it all in one visit!  A nice surprise happened when I went to check out with my two teacups. They were both marked $3 for the cup and saucer, which is at the top of my budget (I've been paying an average of $1.50 for teacups with saucers at Good Will) but, I decided to get them since they were nice and in very good condition. When the lady rang me up she said, 'well, these are on sale today so you get both tea cups and saucers for $3\ SCORE! That made my day....it only made me wonder what else was 'on sale' because then I might have bought more!   Another nice thing about this place is that all proceeds benefit Hospice of the Valley. They said they get two truck loads of stuff every week (I'm not sure from where) besides what people donate. Anyways, it's nice to shop knowing you are benefiting a good cause!"""

This is one of those friendly neighbourhood cafes where the owner seems to know everyone who walks in. It was my first time there and she made an effort to get to know me which was kinda refreshing. The seating was interesting but comfortable (I sat in something that looked like a pew). My only feedback is that the fast Mexican/Spanish music in the background was a little distracting for anyone who wanted to do some work/reading while enjoying their beverage. Would definitely come back though.,1

She wins.  She did not like the <dish>grilled chicken salad</dish> she ordered. Way too much flavorless iceberg lettuce, she said, and the grilled chicken while ok, was nothing special. The dressing was typical processed salad dressing.  But I came for the burgers.  Overall my <dish>double charburger</dish> was good. I liked the onions, and the shredded lettuce and other toppings. The burgers are cooked on a grill, and I thought the patties were a little dry, and not as tender as I would've liked. I really prefer patties cooked on a flat top, they tend to be juicier cooked that way. And there wasn't much char on my burgers, or at least I couldn't taste any.  The fries were a letdown. They're ok, but just ok.   Habit burger was tops in a Consumers Reports reader's survey of Burger chains. But I disagree. It's a step up for sure from Wendy's or McDonalds, but there are better burgers chains out there for sure.",1

4zlztWU9_CqRsFwzvDqAjQ,"'Hot yoga' was not hot. Rather just a warm room and you don't sweat much.   I had a bad experience in this studio that originally I was considering monthly monthly unlimited, but not anymore. One staff I dealt with was kind of condescending and argumentative. Blank faced, deadpan and unfriendly.  With yoga being so cheap and accessible these days, what draws customers in is the ppl and he service. But this studio felt cold and business driven, nothing spiritual as yoga atmosphere should be. This is enforced by the staff I dealt with. I can spend my money on other yoga studios that actually feel like one with better service and people. no thanks."

I had the opportunity recently to converse with both the mead/cider maker and the brewer, and their passion for their work is obvious and translates to the end products. As a card-carrying beer snob, I'm pleased by their variety of interesting brews. There's something for everyone. And I enjoy their meads and ciders because they are balanced and not too sweet.

51K92JdkWICGDvvVCBYhFA,"Something's going downhill with <restaurant>Rubios</restaurant>. Firstly, the food: their quacamole is nasty. I've been coming to Rubios for over a decade and I've never noticed anything wrong with the guac, but I got a bowl this time and the guac was separated... just foul tasting. Next, the service: As our food was delivered to us the worker asked if there was anything else she could get us. We were seated outside and so I asked for a fork. She told me I could go get it up by the Salsa bar. Why ask me if you know quite well that you're not going to get me anything? I'd rather they just call out a number like other fast food restaurants and I can go get the order and everything else I need. But if they're going to make a play of service and actually bring me the food like they do, would it kill them to bring napkins and a fork too? Otherwise I still have to get up and walk all the way to the front. Their bringing food and nothing else to me does me no good.

51adKdYvngq9tJt6m_a9sA,"It's a rather unpleasant place. The staff is cold and unfriendly and clearly far more interested in money than the quality of care or instruction(to me I don't really care about the money but don't like paying for my kids to be unsafe or unhappy.) I could tolerate the poor front desk service if the way they treated the kids was better but having watched it enough I'm not sure it is. Positives:  they are there, they are open. Basically that's it. Sad, if their philosophy  was less about packing as many kids into classes and overcharging everyone (get ready for the \registration fees\"" drop in fees\"" \""class change fees\""....)They need a competitor to come in to area, I know  I'm not alone in my feeling it's both a rip off and poorly run. My kids are older but I would NOT  leave young kids here without staying. During a busy drop off period one day another mom had noticed a kid around 4 wandering through parking lot. She had brought  him to the front desk, turns out he had just wondered out of class and into parking lot(update this actually happened again today which is what prompted me to write this). I witnessed this but have since heard another story that ended with police involvement.  So I guess I recommend it it your kids can keep themselves alive, know not to talk to strangers or leave without you, have robust immune systems(it's really filthy), don't really care if they learn gymnastics or technique, or have fun for that matter. Most of the staff I doubt could ever do a cartwheel.  But if your looking for quality, care, safety or value....this is not it."""

This last time it took 30 minutes and on top of that they put tomato's in my <dish>wrap</dish> which I specially asked for no tomato. I cannot eat tomatoes and I was too angry to wait another 30 minutes for them to remake it. When I tried to get a refund they couldn't because they never gave me my receipt and would have to call their manager which would take an extra 10 minutes. I said forget about it and left.   I will not be returning to this <restaurant>tropical smoothie</restaurant>.  Food like this should NOT take 30 minutes for a wrap. Please train more staff and speed up your service!

59k5QxAyJ3bVEP8-23005A,"Despite my penchant for $1000 handbags, I am a cheap bastard.  I endure the chaos, misery, and dregs of humanity snarfing samples like pigs at the trough that populate Costco for cheap gas, paper towels, toilet paper, Kirkland ibuprofen, toothpaste, and tequila, and more. The thought of wasting cash by paying retail on stupid shit like Ziploc baggies is horrifying.  This particular location is a little ghetto, but not as much so as the one at Christown (my choice of absolute last resort). I recently got new tires here -- you order them online, and then the tires get shipped to the location you want, and then you just show up and they install them at no extra charge. Now, the bummer was that they don't take appointments for this, but if you plan accordingly you can just walk down to Target, and/or slowly consume a delicious strawberry frozen yogurt sundae from the Costco snack bar outside with a good book.  And their house pizza at the snack bar? Killer. There was a stupid Chuck-e-cheese type place back in Chicago my parents used to take me to when I was a kid, and I swear this pizza is identical, so maybe my fondness for it is rooted in nostalgia. I don't care. It is scrumptious."

5GwFUNl6nsDsMuv435G1Eg,"THE WORST!!!!!  I wish I could give zero stars...the people who work here treated me worse than I have ever been treated before.   I went to <restaurant>Coffee Rush</restaurant> one night to get tea. My husband and I were in town for Christmas visiting family, and we stopped here to meet up with two of his old friends.   The guy who took my order was strange. He asked me what I wanted, but before I could say anything he disappeared behind the counter. I waited until he popped back up to yell out my order so I didn't have to repeat myself and when he asked me again what I wanted he seemed really annoyed. I ordered a <dish>tea</dish>. I went to pay and he was taking a second order at the same time, and placed it on the counter with mine, which was confusing. He told me the total, I gave him cash, and when he handed back my change he told me that since less that the majority of my party were ordering drinks I wasn't welcomed to stay and needed to leave immediately! I was pretty shocked considering I had been there for only a few minutes and was asked to leave once they had my money.   This is the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. I don't even live in AZ, but I visit every year and have family there. Not only will I never be back, but I was sure to warn everyone I knew of their horrible treatment of customers. The barista was a total jerk. I'm 27 years old, and from Seattle. I hang out at coffee and tea shops all the time, and have never been kicked out of anywhere my entire life... and this guy had the nerve to treat me like some sort of delinquent.

This was the only vet clinic that I had several friends recommend. We live in Tempe, but still did the drive to their office.

5JGkz9Bkl4zHlH5ljK12Tw,I used to frequent this place when it was Classic Car Spa.  Great service.  I drove out of my way.  I had purched several living social deals a little over a year ago and each deal grants you 3 vouchers for washes that do not expire.  I noticed approx 2 weeks ago they were changing names.  I used a voucher and asked the clerk if they will still be honored and she said YES until at least the end of the year.  So I told my husband and we took our other car today.  The clerk this time tells me they are no longer honoring the vouchers.  Needless to say I was upset and explained what I was told about 2 weeks ago.  Both clerks argued with me and acted as though I was lying.  Nice being embarrassed and treated like a criminal in the store with other customers around.  Customer service is obviously lacking.  I understand they were bought out.  But a better plan on handling these outstanding vouchers should have been in place.  Its just good business practice.  Im sure I will not be the only one complaining!
5JxlZaqCnk1MnbgRirs40Q,"We were in the mood for Mexican and decided to give this place a whirl. There was a wait for the restaurant, but tables at the bar, so we sat at the bar. Chips and salsa were brought immediately as well as our drink order. I thought none of the salsas were particularly hot (I love spicy) but had decent flavor. I had <dish>enchiladas</dish> and my hubby had the <dish>fajitas</dish>. Our meals were fine. There wasn't anything wrong with anything, just nothing memorable or special I guess. Our waiter Paul was excellent. He had all the tables in the bar full and running smoothly, he was quite impressive!",1

I wish I would have taken a pic but before I knew it, it was gone.  One friend ordered <dish>Carne asada fries</dish> and they were good as well. I'll be back for sure and I'm sure my friends will as well.",1
5Lbj9H7dTI8klLkqy5_iFA,"Not pleased with results and booking appointments were ridiculous. I ended up with small red spots on my face that were not there prior to the treatment and it has been a few weeks. I have had other IPL's before and they were amazing. I had another session and cancelled it as I don't want her near my skin. I mean the operator is chatty and seems quite pleasant, but I could care less about talking and more about results."
5LglLdziapvddMigNEAD8A,As a thrifter in San Diego co we don't have savers so I enjoy them when I am out here. This is a nice store and as par for the course some stuff is I feel overpriced and some under. Best find (I always try to post when I thrift) a pair of Papillio sandals 14.99 retail $120. Perfect size and note if I had waited til tomorrow ie 50% off they would have been gone
5Mp-PD_CUaPoJr6CP-WBdA,Ate here before going to see the Jabbawockeez show.  It was okay.  Chipotle is better.  No big deal.,
5NXAbbikpYIa58bwRjs6Tw,Brian North and team are the best! We sold our home in one day and Brian is a great negotiator to get to a fair price. They do a great job staging the house and it showed great. He knows the area and understands the market. We highly recommend Brian and his team. He has sold 2 homes for us and we bought one at the right price. Brian and his team definitely add value and we couldn't be more satisfied with our experience.
5NteKnLm_oMBTALHNiMd6A,I am so happy i found you guys. Ive been having the biggest issue with my garage door getting stuck and not going up when i push the button. They were professional from start to finish. The technician arrived early and fixed it efficiently and i havent had a problem since.
5OZlLXjU0FXUbrw8Scja6g,I called to check on having my tires looked at since my pressure light kept going on.  I heard from a place I take my car for repairs that Discount Tire would fix some leaks for free.  They found a screw in one of my tires and fixed it for free!  Absolutely incredible service from the phone call to check on their services to speaking with Arnold at the location and the overall atmosphere of every team member dealing with every customer in top notch fashion.  These guys deserve every bit of business they get and more.  This is seriously one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had.  A+++!
5PTJ_FzN-tLdt8tZ-vAZFw,"Excellent experience and service. We went to their showroom and met the owner. He was very thorough in explaining everything to us and helped us pick out the best choice for us. We had done a lot of research and it showed this was the best choice best on quality, price, and customer service. We had installation done just a few days later. The installer was prompt and profesional. The installation went perfect. We've had the system for about three weeks now and it has not disappointed. We have soft water through out whole house and reverse osmosis system for our drinking water. This was directly installed to our fridge plus a spout installed on our kitchen sink. They matched the color of our current kitchen brushed nickel accessories so it looks great! Definitely recommend them. I had other system many years ago and this by far is much better. In addition we did not get that horrible sales pitch or pressure just the facts and what we needed as customers. Great job!!!"
5PX6Ekno5-LBmQA2bA_wuQ,"I came here for lip filler and Botox. I usually don't write reviews but my experience was so great that I wanted everyone to know.   Dr. Chen opened the Botox and the Juvederm in front of me from the box. This was my second time getting my lips done and they are SO natural and I had no bruising and very little swelling after I got them done. Dr. Chen really listens to what you want and I love love LOVE my new lips!!!  The girls in front, Kayla and Sarah, are friendly and very professional.   Highly recommend this place!!"
5PlbORAcmUAJ0QCMJRSmDw,"This review is for the <occasion>dinner</occasion> we ordered for last nights Rosh Hashana. The food was awful and in my opinion a total waste of money. The soup tasted like water. The side dishes were totally lacking in flavor, very very bland. I was extremely disappointed and will never order a meal from this establishment again. Do not waste your money.",1
5Qoq8cif3nMCQUN-urH8YA,"Mmm mm mm! I don't get to eat at the <restaurant>Pickle Barrel</restaurant> often anymore but when I do, it's always great!  This location is in the basement of Yorkdale and when we used to live in the area, we came here more often.  We were here one night after work doing a little shopping in our old stomping ground and decided to treat ourselves.   My husband went for the <dish>Rubin</dish> and I opted for the <dish>Cali Chicken Grilled Cheese Sandwich</dish> with the most delicious <dish>Carrot Ginger soup</dish>. Oh. My. God. The soup. So good and with just the right about of bite from the ginger.   Both of our sandwiches were fabulous and very satisfying.   The service was great and our meal came in a reasonable amount of time considering we were there right a peak dinner time.   I'm only knocking then down a star because the table we were first sat at was really dirty and sticky even though it had been wiped down. After we were moved, everything was spot on.   Side note: I recently found out that a Pickle Barrel is opening up close to me!! Yay!! Hold tight for that review!!",1
5SEwzlWlrxSVyZx3IgXwLg,"I lik <restaurant>Marcella's</restaurant>, I really do.  Marcella's reminds me of my shameful visits to Starbucks.  I'm not opposed to either, don't get me wrong, but chains that get it right are a very scary thing to me.  It's easy to hate a chain when their food sucks and their prices aren't that great, but that is not the case with Marcella's.  From their <dish>bruscetta</dish>, <dish>pizza</dish>, <dish>cheese plat</dish>e to their reasonable drink prices, Marcellas is getting it right.  Although the cheese plate didn't come with a knife.  I had to \cut the cheese\"" with a butter knife.  After asking for a sharper tool, I was given a serrated steak knife...  Lame. One thing that must be experienced is their bathroom soap, it may be the best soap in the world.  Reminds me of the pumice soap at my buddies Dad's auto-shop as a kid.  Uberclean!""",1
5SZe-u0hyquuipQL5lbg_g,"My friend and I just now ate here, and I must say, it was the most delightful experience ever! We came very late, and stayed after closing (it was the only time we could come), and we still received excellent service from Grace. She was very polite and very quick to cater to our every need. Now the food.... The food was.. PHENOMENAL!!! Every thing we ordered had such great taste, it was beyond our beliefs. It felt as if we were dreaming!   I ordered <dish>tempura zucchini</dish>, <dish>shrimp tempura roll</dish>, and <dish>beef bowl</dish>. My friend ordered <dish>potato croquettes</dish>, <dish>miso ramen</dish>, and <dish>strawberry mochi ice cream</dish>.  I definitely recommend this place for any person, for the food and the service!!!   Thank you Yatai!       ***UPDATE***  I now go to <restaurant>Yatai</restaurant> regularly It is a big favorite for my friends and me Every time, the food AND the service is so amazing! The taste always fulfills my tastebuds and the people there are always so friendly and polite!",
5SiHMFPhwuWZ4VaZB13Hzw,"Amazing poutine. I had a 23 hour layover in Toronto after being in Japan. I knew it all be worth it if I could find really good poutine and this place came highly recommended. I got <dish>The Works</dish> based off of the recommendation from the guy who was working the counter.  It's poutine with bacon sour cream and chives. There is two different sizes you can get here. One is called \tiny\"" and the other is called regular. The regular is 32 ounces so I went with the tiny which came to be around nine dollars. I have to say this portion was the perfect size and the works was so good. The toppings were amazing and the french fries were delicious. I would have totally gone again the next day if I had time!""",1
5TX8o0vsxFsu9_QPhoeI4A,I like this place! They race stock cars here so you know it's cool. We stayed with relatives in the infield for the race weekend. It was lots of fun and Kevin harvick won like he does every time I go to the races.    The neon garage is probably the coolest thing I've seen at a racetrack. It's an elevated walkway above the garages so you can look down and watch them work on the cars. So cool!
5Ttz3fpkSV69alppIWpDEA,"This is the best pet supply store around! The staff are the most friendly and helpful people, they treat everyone like family. If you want the best food at great prices with truly knowledgeable staff this place can't be beat."
5UK1KtbB1dHTCo0LNDVslA,"I always pass this place and thought their slogan was hilarious. Plastered on all the signage is the phrase \Fresh My Farm.\"" I don't know exactly what this means, I'm assuming it means the food is fresh from the farm but \""Fresh My Farm\"" just always tickled my funny bone. Today I happened to pass by while extremely hungry & I noticed a very faded \""World Famous Fried Squash\"" on the sign & I LOVE <dish>fried squash</dish> so I decided to stop in. Wow. Omg. It was like a joke how scary and run down this place was. There was a back dining room with a sign that said closed but it was still visible & omg was it disturbing. I have some admittedly low standards & expectations but this interior of this place literally startled me. The ceiling is covered in stains, mold & holes & is falling through in many places. There were inexplicable dusty stacks of thick binders on a table. There was a bunch of dry wall lookin stuff just sitting on a table. I guess it had fallen from the ceiling & just been left. I am brave though & I was hungry so I decided to order anyways. The young woman who took my order was unbelievably bubbly, sweet & informative. She is the only reason I am giving two stars. Her personality was so radiant & her good service made me temporarily forget the horrendous surroundings. Unfortunately, the food tasted like the restaurant looked. Sad. Not \""Fresh My Farm\"" at all. The squash was not seasoned & left a bad feeling in my stomach after a couple pieces. I have a stomach of steel so this is concerning. I have a bunch left & unfortunately they'll probably be going in the trash. I'd feed them to my pet rats but I don't want them to get stomach aches like I did.""",1
5V4TsVp5S8FVDo_guJgNzw,"Place had a nice atmosphere and friendly service. Our server was prompt, courteous, and made great recommendations. The <dish>street roll</dish> was the best dish we ordered - definitely a must-try! The <dish>karaage</dish> and <dish>ceviche</dish> were also very good.",1
5V9i2FuhQ3o8ynYwbubmQg,"For Terminal A this is your best choice for dining.  Your other options here are Wendy's, Cinnabon and the per-packaged sandwich, salad place connected to this bar.  And basically it is a bar with hamburgers, a grilled chicken sandwich, flatbread pizza and fries and nachos.  The food is decent (they toasted the bun of my <dish>chicken sandwich</dish> which was nice) and the staff is friendly.  If you have more time you could wander the other terminals and find something with a little more variety.  But if you need to stick close to your gate but have time for a sit-down meal and want a drink this is you best and only option.",1
5VXxZIMgoKRWbNa6x9kMfw,"They have <dish>peanut butter sandwiches</dish> now, people. Did you hear me? Peanut.butter.sandwiches.   And how about the fact that you can pretty much include any of their toppings on it, including bacon, honey, banana, sprinkles, chocolate, whatever. Hot damn.   Of all the times I've been here I think I've only had one thing I didn't like and that's the <dish>white cheddar popcorn</dish>. And let me be clear here--I love popcorn. I love cheese. Combine the two and I'm normally in heaven. But their just didn't \do it\"" for me. There was no zesty, cheesy flavor and it left a very strange film in my mouth... ick!

I ordered from the lunch menu which come with soup. The <dish>soup</dish> was delicious and the <dish>vegetable skillet</dish> was hot and good.  The only thing is they don't do substitution for vegetable but that's ok. Overall, this location got much better.  I will go there again next time with my friends.",1

When we arrived, we were the only customers. So, we were able to have one of the staff members walk around with us and tell us about the different oils and vinegars, where they came from, what kind of foods to use with them, and which oils and vinegars complement each other.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they offer many brandy's, liqueurs, vodkas, and other spirits.   This store isn't just about retail, it's an experience.   I am bringing my best friend and mom up here next weekend and I can't wait!"

When our garage door broke, our cars were trapped inside! Jamison arrived, explained what was wrong, explained our options for repair, and reviewed pricing for each option. He was kind, courteous, and very helpful. He lifted the door and propped it open so that we could get the cars out, then he completed the repair in a timely fashion. I like how he took the time to really explain things to us and answered all of our questions. I would definitely recommend this company, but I feel sorry for anyone who needs them -- broken garage doors aren't fun!"

I received a call when they were on the way.  They showed up on time and ready to help.  Luckily we only needed some routine maintenance for the door.  He was very accommodating and provided quick service.  I also appreciated him not trying to sell us something we didn't need.  He was absolutely professional.    It's always nerve racking when calling someone to your home.  I was just happy to find a trustworthy business.  Upright Garage Door Services will always be on my good list.

Lots of choice of ingredients to put on your burger like eggplant or avocado, and tons of sauces to choose from.  Price: about $11-20 for a burger.

5e0XIxlGRu4WfQzozclRaA,"Most people know about Jojos from Farmers Markets or events. Same goes for me as I discovered them during a Yelp Christmas event. Recently they opened up a storefront in the Container Park (which has a separate listing) that is gaining them new fans. This location in Chinatown is their main office hub where the jerky is made, but they do sell their products here as well.   It was right by work, so we decided to swing by once we found out it existed. The one downside is there isn't samples to try of the jerky before buying at this location. I assume they don't get that many people at this location and mainly is just their office.   We decided to get wasabi flavor jerky, peppered strips, carloca carne asada jerky, and their jerk spice dry rub. The Carne asada and dry rub we threw into a gift for someone so I can't comment on that, but the other two were for us. The wasabi flavor was nice, but it was a tad salty for me. Their jerky isn't the thin sheet style, but more like chunks or nuggets which is tender and a bit more moist.The strips is pounded out meat that's formed into shape which is normally not my thing as most of them just taste fake and low quality, but I like their quality. I think I may like it better than the chunk jerky even.  Support your locals! This is definitely better than average product and it really doesn't cost more than store brand jerky that is levels below in quality."

My husband and I took took the beginner's class which was a great introduction to the process.  The class was really designed to allow you to see if you're interested in moving forward with future classes.  Although we didn't get to work with color in this particular class, the instructors safely guided us through the steps to make our own glass flowers.  Although it was a group class, we made our flowers one at a time so we each had the complete attention of the instructors.  I was a little nervous I might put someone's eye out with my stick of molten glass, but everyone left in one unburned piece.  You will have to pick up your flowers at a later date at their studio on Roosevelt.  Surrounded by beautiful creations, the studio is a great place to see that your flower is not really that great, and you will need more classes!"

5hqGQR3YJni73ky8vMXG5w,I'd give this theater 2.5 stars. This place has zero leg room and the seats don't recline. Also the food selection is really limited.

I've also had a chance to see one of the staff members (he has cool hair) be super friendly to someone who appeared to be homeless.

You guys just gained a forever customer. I also love the style of this salon it's modern and not like most salons you see. It's very clean and I just am in love with this place. Thanks you guys!
5sy9ljRf2rq_DtIn6j4_cw,"When I first purchased my car I would have given them one star. I actually use to tell people when they asked about my car that I would recommend a Mini to anyone except people who lived in the Charlotte Area because I hated Hendrick Mini. At one point they had a company event and forgot about my car and kept it for 2 days just because I needed a light bulb changed.   I am telling you all of this because they have really turned things around in my mind because of their service department. I get basically everything done there. The last 2 years the service has been impecable.    - The speed for which they complete my work is in half. I can now schedule an apt basically when ever I need to as opposed to waiting 2 weeks like before.    - They offer great service discounts via their newsletter (email) and on their website. With this coupons I'm paying the same as anywhere else for people who actually know and understand my car.  - They always tell me up front what the computer says needs to be done, and what they costs are. Even if somethign comes up they always inform me of the costs and how long things should take.    - As an added bonus the waiting room is comfortable. Wi-fi is now password protected and always works perfectly. They have a firdge with drinks and coffee always available.  I'm happy to say I can now recommend everyone in Charlotte to not only purchase a Mini but to get your car serviced at Hendrick Mini."

Owning my own small business I know his kind and sometimes you just can't please someone no matter how hard you try. Trust me these guys are top notch, they work on my wife's bike, my daughters bike and now my bike and we would not trust anyone else."

5w14RG5oIfgJ4SokBPIA0w,"Amazing! I was visiting Toronto from the States and, on a whim, walked into this store. Normally, when I shop for frames, I have to count on at least 30 minutes with the specialists to find a frame that is even remotely flattering. Here? She saw me walk in, heard my specs, and then walked over to a pair that was perfect! While she ultimately pulled down at least 15 pairs to consider, it was the first pair she found that was the winner.  Unfortunately, being an American, I had only dollars and an Discover card on me. And that credit card doesn't work in Canada. I wasn't judged, they still helped me, and even wrote down the model/make of the frame so that I could order it later at my convenience.  Thanks, Optic Zone!"
5xO9UCs9aDS2Sm3okiUFGg,"Probably the BEST customer service experience I've ever had.  They truly care about their customers.  Unfortunately the mattress was a bit too firm for me (but it really was an excellent quality mattress!)  To be fair, I prefer the most ultra plush mattress on the market.  I really wanted to buy from Tuft, because I believe they are the most ethical mattress store on the planet.  Anyway, they made everything so easy & convenient when donating the mattress & processed my refund the day Salvation Army picked up.  Just amazing.  THANK YOU T/N!"

I will do as much justice as one possibly can as a \non-gay bar patronizing straight girl.\"" I didn't drink since I had to be a DD, nor did I eat (not sure what they serve there.) I know one main wome'ns room was OOS, but I heard there was a backup (didn't need to use.) I believe there is a cover, but I was not charged. They have drink specials, like spend $15, get $25 worth, though not sure how often that's run. When I checked in through yelp There was a bogo special. With the wedding party, we had an area reserved, so the fact that you CAN reserve areas is cool. There is also a big dance area/stage for bands and events (which I typically don't see in bars) that had a gameshow going on hosted by awesome, beautiful drag queens. :D I had a pretty good time. Step outside your comfort zone :)"""

The response was; it's not the season and our supplier didn't have them ... ok ... fair enough. .. I was kind of upset as this is my regular crepe .... my wife convinced me to get apples instead .. I agreed and asked the waiter to put apples on the side ... my wife and our friend ordered hot drinks ...

I started to eagerly look around for my <dish>crepe</dish> ... their drinks were about half way done .. before my crepe arrived ... already being upset for not having strawberries ... guess what? The apple topping was on top of the crepe NOT on the side as ordered ... the waiter agreed to make it right .. another 5 minutes passed by and their hot drinks were finishing up ... so I gave up and asked my waiter to bring the bill ... and the bill arrived and sure enough that crepe that never made it properly to my table was on the bill ..

Adding a bit soy chilli to it was a good mixture for a hint of spice because it can get really spicy and sweaty but can always request for more tissue as they are friendly servers.   Served in fairly medium sized bowls and is comfortable spot to eat and kill time or as a fast meal. The menu is pretty straight forward can choose from Lo Mein to Noodles in soup with choice of noodles such as egg noodle, rice noodle, or vermicelli with either sliced beef or beef balls, cuttle/dace fish balls, or shrimp wonton/dumpling etc. Price range (~$5.75-$6.50) is a little pricy for serving size but can definitely make up for quality.

We were greeted by Paul who gave us direction on the sofa we were looking for and gave us the time to see if this is what we wanted. We needed to match a love seat that will remain in the same room. After selecting the perfect color match this took the sofa out of the price range. So, Paul was able to redirect with other options to put us back to the price range we were willing to spend. Together with Shelly, we experienced teamwork, knowledge of the product and found what should be the perfect fit for us. Never feeling pressure to purchase anything more than what we wanted. We have family who have purchased after seeing the quality of the product. We would purchase again soon, if we could buy outdoor furniture. B & D"
6ExIH5FoPyMRhtz4p-2K1g,"<restaurant>Sushi Rock</restaurant> is boring. That's my short version - cliff notes if you will.   The sushi is fine. The atmosphere is fine. The drinks are overpriced and the service is, well, its fine. To me Sushi Rock is like the Applebee's of sushi joints - chain restaurant with a standard watered down menu that appeals to the masses. Yes, they have cheap sushi on Wednesday, but do you really want to eat \discount fish\""? I don't. If you've ever researched \""fish specials\"" at restaurants, you'd know that it goes on sale right before they have to toss it in the garbage. Still impressed? The best item I've had at Sushi Rock is the <dish>calamari</dish> and it is FRIED. That says a lot to me about a sushi restaurant.   Have I been to Sushi Rock more than once, yes. Do I look forward to going there, no. Its downtown, which is convenient and its sushi, so people think they are being exotic by picking it. I'm never going to fight anyone on the suggestion (especially if they are paying - its not cheap), but I won't ever make the suggestion myself.""",1

6G_S11aSDjdYnvqRaF24_w,"Felt like a comfy traditional pub.  Dark wood everywhere.  Surprisingly well lit for a pub, which I quite liked.  Went on a Monday when they have trivia night.  I'm usually pretty critical of comedians, but the host of trivia night was pretty amusing.  He does occasionally curse on the mic, which I didn't mind, but just FYI if you're bringingthe clergy.  First round trivia winners get a pitcher of beer.  Their beers on tap are pretty standard for the GTA; no super intriguing imports on tap.  The server was nice and cheery. HOWEVER, she was uneducated about some food I ordered.  I ordered the <dish>Haddock Finger appetizer</dish>.  I specifically asked if it is made like traditional fish and chips that are dipped batter; I was told yes that the only difference is that there is chipotle tartar sauce instead.  I did enjoy them (very moist), but was irked since it was my birthday and I was treating myself to fried food that I rarely eat and come to find out it is just a flour dredged spiced breaded and not what I had been craving.  Comes with a side a fries, which is not stated on the menu, so I was pleasantly surprised to have a side salad substitute included in the cost of the meal.  <dish>Greek salad</dish> was pretty fresh by pub standards.  <dish>Sticky toffee pudding</dish> -- why, why, why?!!!  Why did you ruin it?  Again, this was a long-awaited birthday craving.  Sticky toffee is known for being caramel smothered sticky goodness.  So, why did the server smother the top with chocolate and strawberry sauce?!  GROSS.  I didn't want it to taste like a banana split.  Guess the server didn't really understand the point of sticky toffee is to be a caramel delivery system.  The cake was too dense for my liking and more dense than any other I'd had in the city; didn't mind it, but wasn't my fave.  What little caramel sauce I could taste by itself was yummy & had a house made taste.  My other half liked their style of <dish>chips</dish> (fries).  Skinny fries (not steak fries), though, not quite as skinny or crispy as McDonalds.  Some skin was still on the tips, which he prefers.  Several TVs with different types of sports going at once.  Some cigarette smoke does waft in since there are several sidewalk tables scrunched by the front doors.  So move to the back or the right of the restaurant if you're sensitive  I think it's a good place to unwind, I don't think it's the kind of place you'd take someone to impress them.  Good mix of people of various adult ages, but probably not the type of pub place where people tend to bring kids.  The Abbott & Duke of York might be more kid and family oriented, but I wouldn't be too worried if the kiddos tagged along.",1
6Hnf8Vk2BOuyDf11PZdvSw,"I am only going to review the burger. I didn't sit down to enjoy a burger and a beer, so I have no comment about the beer or the waitstaff - except that they got my order wrong. I ordered a \<dish>Crafty Burger</dish>\"", the standard lettuce, tomato, onions, and added mayo - to go. I had heard some good things about this place, and I'm burger obsessed, so I wanted to give it a try. When I got home and opened up the box, I audibly gasped, \""What?!\"" First, the burger only had mayo, sans the lettuce, tomato, and onions. But when you think a place is going to give you a special burger experience, you're naturally shocked to face what amounts to a Sheetz gas station burger. In fact, I've had better burgers from a Sheetz. If I can find a way to post a picture, I will. This is not a crafty burger. This is not an artisan burger. This is not even a tasty burger. If it wasn't for the ketchup, there would have been no taste at all. And it was small. The <dish>sweet potato fries</dish> were okay. They definitely have a large selection of burgers, with all different types of toppings. Maybe it was my fault for ordering the basic burger, and they didn't even give me all the toppings included with the basic, so it may not be fair to judge the taste of their burgers, but even if you added the toppings, the burger was still small. <dish>Barrel Burger</dish>, it is sad to say, offers a better burger and it's right down the street.""",1
6JKGSFvTKfBhnwJ-gBKw5A,"Cool, but TOO MANY COOKS IN THE KITCHEN! I want to let everyone know because it is not listed on their website, nor was it listed on the Groupon... The max number of people allowed in the room is 8, but what they DON'T tell you is if you do not bring 8 people, they will stick you in the room with enough strangers to fill the room to max capacity. For example, there were 3 of us (our 4th person didn't show), so they stuck us with 4 complete strangers. It would have been nice to know that BEFOREHAND! Completely threw us a curve ball. We are family who do not see each other often and were looking forward to some bonding time. Luckily the 4 people were cool, but it got to the point that it was too many cooks in the kitchen and towards the end 2 or 3 of us just became observers while the others tried to figure out the last clues. It would have just made things confusing for everyone to chime in. The puzzle room was really difficult (not necessarily a bad thing), so not sure just the 3 of us could have done it in one hour (we'll never know), but 7 was definitely too many people, especially with people you don't know. It would have been really nice to know we'd be stuck with strangers ahead of time! I think it is shady business practice. They want to keep as many time slots open as possible so they make as much money as possible. Understood a business needs to be profitable. But the fact that they don't mention it until you get there is shady."

6_EtvZaCNAcMupAPwVhh_A,The city ofElyria does not accept criminal reports and Keeps their criminal statistics low by refusing to accept reports of criminal activities. If they don't accept the report from the victim then their crime statistics are lower and they look better. My computer was stolen and the police won't let me file s police report! Especially avoid the Days Inn which is frequented by truckers prostitutes and tweekers or two of the three combined. The help steals from their  guests and are complicit in criminal activities. The biggest problem however is the City police department which refuses to accept crime reports. They are being investigated by the Federal Department of Justice. Avoid All business in Elyria- do not stop there as the whole city is involved in criminal activity and the police department and mayor are corrupt.
6a3n4Hd0niHndoPywSkb7Q,"I stopped by in the afternoon (Friday), after 5pm, and though there weren't a lot of people,  the service was awfully slow (took 1/2 hr just to get a cake at the counter, and there was only ONE person ahead of me!). I got the <dish>coffee cake</dish>, and well, just like the poor service, the cake was not good at all: I bought the coffee cake but got white cake with caramel chunks only! The only good thing about it is that since it was pretty much plain, I was able to throw in some caramel syrup around it and aborted birthday cake disaster",1

People that shop here are bottom of the barrell hill billy trailer trash (on second thought, what does that say about me hmmm I hope not much?!)  Truthfully, only come here for the cheap prices on laundry soap, beauty products and Frisky cat food cans. Their food selection is that of a barrio's tienda - think Food City.   Also refuse to get rung up by cashiers, Wal-Mart really does stay true to their EOE hiring procedures. Cashiers are either 80 years old and suffering from paralysis or 20 years old with learning disabilities....

Staff seemed very nonchalant, tables and floor eating area extremely dirty; maybe from the morning donut traffic? Seating both indoors and outdoors, and high chairs for the little ones. They're just around the corner from the mall restrooms and the splash pad is not too far either. We tried a mix of of flavors, and they were ok. They're definitely more on the dense type of donuts, but they do make them fresh, so eat them at the store as they don't travel or reheat well.",1

6hpfRwGlOzbNv7k5eP9rsQ,"My friend is a vegan and usually we only come out to vegan places for her birthday. <restaurant>Blossom</restaurant> opens at 11:30am for <occasion>lunch</occasion> buffet (Came on a Saturday) So we decided to come then.   Restaurant was very spacious with high high ceilings and bright lighting. There was a noodle bar near the mall entrance as well as dessert and fruit fridge near the entrance also. I wished they had some covering for those sections..cause people that enter in, carry dust and germs in and it will definitely fly on to the food etc..or even people's hair, coughing and sneezing..etc..   Oh the weird thing about it, is you have to pay first before you eat...maybe because they are under staffed? And also because they have noodle bar and dessert near the entrance. They are afraid ppl will eat and go and they won't know about it?  Water is self service, for cold that is, it's also near the entrance. Actual buffet area isn't that large either. Perhaps they have another set of buffet tables for upstairs, if they ever have a full house? Again I wished they had some coverings for the quinoa salad and sushi..cause I saw a few fruit flies buzzing over them.   They had a couple of dim sum items, stir fries, noodles, rice, braised dishes, deep fried items, soups, sweet soups..etc  My fave items were:  <dish>Fried Golden Dumpling</dish> (Salted Water Triangle) The filling waa enough and balanced it with then pastry exterior. Nice Crisp and Chewiness.  <dish>Deep Fried Spring Rolls</dish>  Nice Crisp but I think also we were the 1st ones in the restaurant it was fresh!  <dish>XO Sauce Stir Frief Noodles</dish> The sauce was a bit spicy but the flavour was nice.   <dish>Noodles Wrapped With Soya</dish> (Stirred Fried Cheong Fun) Rice rolls were fresh and stirred fried just right with the soya sauce. Nice Chewy Texture and Moist and Soft inside.  <dish>Fried Rice with Pickled</dish> Olives The combo of the fried rice and pickled olives, gave the rice a nice salty and flavorful taste. It had some wok smell too, which was good!  My friend did have some of their <dish>stir fried choy</dish> and found there was quite a bit of sand though.  I alao checked out their washroom in the basement..the place is huge and has more private rooms downstairs. But the individual room stall washroom were gross.....no air circulation...it literally smelled like sh*t....either it was dirty diapers in the waste basket..or actual sh*t in the waste basket...I tried to not breathe and high tailed out of there when I was done.  We literally sat in the restaurant for 2hrs or so. Eventually around 1ish..maybe 3 other tables filled up. We chatted for awhile and eventually everyone left and we were the last to leave as well.   They were tentative with our dirty plates and hot water, but never did they come by to ask if we were ok etc..And even when we left there was no thank you or or goodbye. Lol",1
6i85_hLuAdymNIy01LLl0g,"I LOVE this store!! I really love the concept of Sam's Club, considering that my mom has been a member since the stone age. She always made sure to get good deals and save money on what should be purchased in bulk. Over the years, I have learned to coupon so I realize the value in many items I purchase. If I can get it cheaper via couponing, I will hold off and just make sure to prioritize that with my next coupon run! I usually divide the amount of items by the amount I pay to see if what I purchase is worth it, but if you ever take a good look at the tags of all the items, you will see a 'per unit' 'per oz/lb/etc' price to make things more transparent to you as far as savings go!   I remember coming here as a kid and eating the hot dog on my way out. It's so funny to see my kids asking once in a while for a hot-dog because it reminds me of my younger self. This is m  I always check out the little 'clearance' or markdown area in the back, because I have always scored some really great deals on some last-minute items. Another favorite is the gas, it's usually some of the cheapest in the valley. This Sam's can get a bit busy, so expect some lines! This isn't my normal, local Sam's Club but I do like changing it up a bit!"
6idwaOv7HpxCr_0MZgNTTg,I absolutely loathe having to deal with this company.If there is a little problem like a minor plumbing issue they will tend to it within a day or so. If you have a more expensive fix like ac or washing machine then like others say they hang up-stall-or keep you on hold when you call for a response.It costs me a $70.00 co pay to tell me my washer had to be replaced. Two weeks have gone by and they decided I should have a much cheaper quality replacement.I refused and am still haggling with them.My ac kept using Freon and I found out later that it was because my unit was dying -they charged me a ridiculous fee each time for Freon and $150.disposal fee?They never could fix it right so I wound up buying a new unit.They did not help with the replacement cost even though it is supposed to be covered.I have had several other misadventures with this company.I think they use caller id and do not respond to your calls if they do not want to respond.
6kcjOA5J8NFgkx7DsrKghg,"I loved this place, went once and got the Vanilla Birthday Cupcake for my one niece for Christmas and then had to go back again to get more!! I ended up getting 3 of the cotton candy donuts for my other nieces as stocking stuffers, they smelled heavenly! I also got 2 of the Fruit Smoothie body scrubs, how could I not after trying them! I also got a customized fragrance body butter in Pink Candy, which is so wonderful.

6lsVNfl7fLi8uQaG3BMJFw,"Never again!  Seems it is a common practice for their employees to state a certain time frame and yet once they have you on the hook, you have no choice but to wait twice as long!  I dropped off my IPad on Friday afternoon.  Monday afternoon came and no phone call that it was fixed.  I decided to stop at their office which I waited in line for 15 minutes.  Two new patrons dropped off their devices and were told 30-45 minutes to fix their device.  Once my turn came the employee behind the counter informed me that my device wasn't done and would have to wait another three hours!  The employee had no response why I had to wait another three hours and new patrons could get theirs done in 30- 45 mins?!  On my second attempt to pick up my IPad, two new patrons complained about being told one time frame and Ubreakifix not  keeping their word.  Ubreakifix needs to have some common courtesy of people's time. I should've read others reviews before using this service. Congratulations Ubreakitifix, you have lost yet another potential and loyal customer."
6nEViBc5SbWHOutOSsCVDQ,"This stadium is pretty huge. Even in the sections higher up you can still see what's happening on the field. From where I was sitting I could hear the band, see the field and where the fireworks were being lit off. Not bad at all. It gets pretty crowded so to get through the crowds hold your friend's hand and weave in and out. You will save a bunch of time when getting out of the stadium. They don't serve beer, but you can bring in a bottle of water if you haven't opened it. Don't lose your ticket because it might be hard to remember where you were sitting. Or maybe that's just me. Oh one more thing, if you go to a day game, wear sunscreen and bring sunglasses! You'll thank me!"

6sATfFam9_q9uod0I2aCsg,"I visited with my family to celebrate an early Mother's Day. We do not typically eat vegetarian dishes. My mom's friend recommended this place, so we decided to give it a try. Overall the food was surprisingly good. We liked the <dish>Crispy Fried Milk with </dish>mushrooms, which had the nice salty-sweet contrast. <dish>Mapo Tofu</dish> was passable but nothing I would die for. My mom found a hair in the dish, and the server promptly switched it to something else. Our favourite was the <dish>Lohan Noodles</dish>, which was like Cantonese Chow Mien but with mushrooms. After the meal, the server served us some <dish>sweet almond soup</dish> as a dessert. The only thing we did not like was that everything we ordered was a touch more greasy that we were comfortable with. If we come back, then I would include non-greasy dishes in my order.,1"

6ti3AWLJ3wXsgDcTg3SzOw,"Went to <dish>jack astor's</dish> for valentines day. We were smart and arrived for 5pm early <occasion>dinner</occasion>.  The service was very good. The place was packed. I was not blown away by the food.  We tried the following:  <dish>Crab and Lobster Dip</dish>: This dish was very salty, the quantity of dip seemed a bit small and the seafood was sparse.  The dish seemed large, but it was not deep. We enjoyed eating the warm pitas served, but we ran out of dip, so I took home the left over nachos. Would not repeat this appetizer because it seemed very processed and not at all homemade.   <dish>Buffalo Chicken Cobb Salad</dish>: We were sharing apps, so the waitress split the salad on to two plates for us, which was very nice.  There was too little bacon and blue cheese for my liking. The chicken was absolutely delicious. Celery seemed to be an odd choice to have in the salad. I did not like the dressing. I would not purchase this cobb salad again.  <dish>Brownie filled cookie with vanilla ice cream</dish>: The over sized cooked was served warm and the vanilla ice cream was delicious. I would order this again  <dish>Banana Split</dish>: This was marketed as a kid size, but it was massive, my whole family could have shared it.    <dish>Rubbarb Cheesecake</dish> in a mason jar: I had high expectations for this dessert and did not love it. In fact, I thought it lacked a homemade quality. The cheesecake pieces were rectangular and seemed very processed, almost like it came out of a freezer.  Overall, I think Jack's might be a meat restaurant because the buffalo chicken ontop of the cobb salad was amazing, crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle.  My husband went to jack's last week and had the steak, he said it was comparable to the keg and he is a big red meat guy.",1
6tpH6roCryLArAvWVKFLyQ,"Bow to Nikki and <restaurant>Eddie V's</restaurant>! I have been to many Yelp events (Elite and non-Elite) over the last several years. I've seen that it's difficult for establishments to wow a crowd when there isn't a lot of other stuff to do (such as games) besides eat and drink. However, when the food and the staff are amazing, that is all that is needed.  I had only heard of Eddie V's when this event was listed. You wouldn't know it, but it's owned by Darden (the same group that owns The Capital Grille, and yes - Olive Garden). Extra points if it's named after Eddie Vedder but I have no idea if it is.  There was a gas leak uptown earlier in the day. Actually, it was right next to Eddie V's. Since the gas was cut off, it made it extremely difficult for the restaurant to coordinate this event. Also, since the weather was brisk, the event took place downstairs in two private dining rooms instead of on the patio. It was a little crowded but not overwhelming.   The staff was amazing. Everyone from the hostesses to the servers to the bartenders to the chef to the GM was very friendly and literally catered to everyone. All of the food was good but there were some standouts. The <dish>prime rib sliders</dish> were just ridiculously awesome as were the <dish>crab cakes</dish>. These had a lot of crab meat in them and no filler and they tasted \clean\"". While those items tied for number one, the prime rib at the carving station was a close second. I didn't even put sauce on it because the meat was so good.   I know Nikki has had a lot on her plate recently, so extra thanks to her for coordinating this. The Yelposphere and Charlotte is lucky to have her!""",1

Every store seems laid out in a weird fashion, so I end up walking back and forth a dozen times to find all of my items.    2. You rarely see employees on the floor.  Sometimes you need help and need to ask a question.  Well good luck here because you can't find anyone that works here except the cashiers up front.  What's the deal?  3. When you do encounter an employee, they are not very nice.  Come one people, a smile every now and then is good for your soul, so smile!  4.  I always forget about the self bagging.  Of course this is when I have a ton of stuff and a wiggly, into everything toddler with me.

I thought the colors were amazing, the price point was cheaper than MAC, and most of all the packaging was gorgeous. I told myself, you want that... you neeeeeeed that.  So during our trip to Las Vegas, I searched YELP for Inglot stores. Bingo! There was one in Town Square which was near to the place we were staying. My birthday was also coming up in a few days, so I decided to do some early birthday shopping. ;D  The makeup gals were nice and helpful... One of the gals explained how their Freedom Palette worked: pick an eyeshadow palette (2, 4, 5, 10). Then you get to swatch/choose any eyeshadow color you want and stick it onto a magnetic board for the makeup gals to grab for you. I was so excited! I must have spent about half an hour to 45 minutes swatching alone... eek. I wanted to try some of their other products and ended up picking up a toner, foundation, and concealer.

Maybe a lot of it had to do with miscommunication, but it certainly could have been handled differently.    8 of us went to Chiado for lunch today to try their Winterlicious menu. When we arrived the first feeling I got was that they were under-staffed. The staff seemed to be rushing about and acting very clipped and abrupt. They weren't necessarily being rude, but they were not being friendly either. But we were okay with it. We understood that things get pretty busy during Winterlicious and the staff can get overwhelmed. That's ok.    We were all able to order very quickly and the food did not take long to arrive. I had the <dish>grilled squid</dish> and it was spectacular. My friends had the <dish>bisque</dish> and <dish>salmon tartar</dish> and they loved it too. For my main I had the <dish>salmon</dish>, and loved the crust on the salmon and the array of vegetables that came with it. We ordered pretty much every main dish in the menu and everyone cleared their plate. The desserts were small, but very beautifully presented and packed with flavor. Again, we cleared our plates.  We loved our meal.   And then it all went down hill from here....  1 person in our party had ordered a glass of <dish>wine</dish>, one had a <dish>sprite</dish> and 2 had <dish>coffees</dish>. We received the bill and we were charged for 2 glasses of wine, so my friend asked for the correction to be made. No problem. Then we all calculated our totals, and had to call our waiter over several times to ask questions (how much tip were we being charged for example), but getting our waiter's attention was like pulling teeth. He was always around us, but just seemed to not be able to see us. I had to raise my voice to have him come over with a machine so we could take care of the bill. We all added more than 18% to the tip because we really did like the food. When we thought the bill had been settled, the waiter came over to our table and made an \announcement\"" that our bill was short by a few dollars. \""Odd\"" we said, \""we all put more than 18% in tip.\"" So we did the math again and could not figure out where we went wrong. So we called the waiter over and requested the bill. The waiter then proceeded to tell us again that we were short. \""We know.\"" I said. \""But we want to see the bill.\"" I felt like I would have to get up and physically go grab the bill myself by the way he seemed to stall. But eventually he brought the bill. He then proceeded to condescendingly break down the bill. A friend of mine grabbed the bill and noticed that we were charged approximately $18 for the water. Huh? It turns out that we had 2 bottles of water that cost approximately $7.50 each. We wanted tap water, but instead we got bottled water. We could care less about bottled water. It tasted like tap water to us. But my friend acknowledged that she was asked when she arrived (she was first to arrive) if the table would want sparkling or still water. She said still. She figured still water was tap water. Well, apparently not. Every restaurant we have ever been to, we have been given the choice between \""tap\"" water and bottled water. Even as we realized why there was a discrepancy in the bill and were telling the waiter that now we understood why we were short, he was still repeating that we were short.  We were trying to acknowledge that we made the error of not accounting for the water but he continued to speak over us and telling us that we were short. This whole situation could have been handled differently. The minute we learned of the water, we took care of it. We did not complain about the water or the cost. We never said we wanted \""tap\"" water, so the responsibility was on us to be more clear. But the way our waiter spoke to us; it was not very professional.  So, would I return to Chiado? The food was amazing. But the service killed my entire experience. During lunch I was already thinking of all the people I wanted to bring here over the next few months. By the time I was putting on my coat, I wanted to get the hell out of there. It was such a disappointing end to what could have been an amazing lunch.""",1
7IOt1SahnsyuMwTcuZgFLQ,"\What an awesome idea - a spot specializing in gilled cheese. As soon as my coworker recommended this tiny joint, we made plans to visit it. A great location too - right across the movie theatre on Richmond St W. An orange oval with a bold slab serif typeface, the branding is really not memorable and neither the rustic wood glued on the glass. However the food made up for any disappointments. There are quite a few options, including a poutine section and milkshakes...\""   This is just a bite of our full review..""",1
7JDxP9DXn2A-vqkQ9Jy-fQ,"I worked with Jennifer Hibbard of Twins & Co to buy my first house this summer. It actually has been a fun and positive experience thanks mostly to Jennifer's constant help and guidance. She definitely gets my highest recommendation. I initially asked friends for Realtor references and while I was awaiting replies from 2-3 realtors, I decided to search on Yelp. Based on all these 5* reviews I gave Twins & Co an email... within minutes I had a reply and Jennifer set up an MLS internet search. Within a couple days we were looking at houses! Thanks again Yelp!  Jennifer was super knowledgeable about the areas I was looking in Arcadia and South Scottsdale... but based on conversations she works all over the Valley. She responds to emails and txts instantaneously. She helped me find inspectors and contractors. Whatever you need related to your home purchase, I imagine she will help you get it done. My purchase was a short sale and it all worked out well in a timely manner.   I am a picky person and Jennifer completely surpassed my expectations. If you need a realtor to buy or sell your house I suggest you contact Jennifer and Twins & Co. Good luck!"

Well, if you looked at it now you couldn't even tell it ever happened. They did such a great job. Not only did they take care of my cake situation, but they also came within the hour of my first text inquiring if they could do the job. Very convenient and fast . AND,  (ladies) the icing on the cake was, they were both super cute!!!  ;) thank you guys for the amazing job, can't wait to use you guys again!"
7K9EGbodeoDoOzQvkNPoAw,"First time visiting this theatre... my husband and I went to see Spiderman Homecoming last night and decided that we deserved some VIP action.   Clean establishment! Great service and friendly staff! When ordering drinks We recommend going for 2oz vs 1oz (could barely taste the alcohol)  I think there should be(something cineplex could consider) the option to order virtually from your seats ... such as having an app or having some kind of device by the seats for clients to use. Just an idea :)  Good Sound! Good Size screen!  Seats were comfortable (but nothing to write to your mom about) oh and they have the reserved seats system which we love! The seats are in pairs of 2... so makes for a pleasant and intimate experience. Restrooms: they were clean and private! That was neat! I wonder why there is only 1 VIP theatre around? Like why not have VIP theatres at popular locations i.e. Downtown, Marché Centrale, West Island, Laval, and Vaudreuil... that way the great experience can be spread across the board.. ?? Again just an idea. Overall great experience... and after the movies you can indulge in something sweet by taking a mini stroll over to Chocolat Favoris :)"
7L2Yq1FpshwgYnuHy-BUQg,"I had not been to a mid-priced Chinese buffet for a while, because I didn't recall a good experience in recent memory.  <restaurant>Super Buffet</restaurant> changed this perception last Wednesday ($21 per person).

7LLU_dpe7iN97nJzYmTvjQ,I have been looking for a hibachi takeout for a while and I came across this one. I honestly was disappointed my food had no flavor if it wasn't for the shrimp sauce I wouldn't have been able to eat it all.   The customer service was decent but I would not return or recommend this restaurant.  I do like the fact that they do not use MSGs in their food.,1
7LzhLKAwS7PHUvaPIW833A,"Wow! Worst meal I have had in a very ling time. Came with good non-Yelp reviews. Totally disappointed. Started out with bread basket--with bread from a bag....and cold! Next came the <dish>calamari</dish>--love the calamari (NOT!)--first it was luke warm and the dish (not to mention the calamari itself) was covered in a thin coat of grease. Very pedestrian, highly processed calamari anyway. So we move on. <dish>Cheese pizza</dish> for my son--ok, ok this is more like it (but, really, how can you screw up a simple cheese pizza). Then out <dish>salads</dish>--big giant of overpriced bowls of glop. It was like a treasure hunt for the greens. Then the entrees--again more glop. I ordered the <dish>FEAST with shrimp, mussels, clams</dish>--well, at least there was supposed to be some seafood. I did find a shrimp or two, but no clams. Again, very heavily processed oversalted dish. My wife had the <dish>Pasta Dominic</dish>--this was actually OK if you could look past the gloppy pasta sauce. So all of this cost us over $80, when it should have cost about $35 for the quality. Either way, I am fasting today to get this crap out of my system and I'll never return. And I'll never trust a review that's not on Yelp or Roadfood.com.",1

7MssGOl7IeOYCPn6uuSGxw,"After my visit in Vietnam in my last trip, I have been a fan of Banh Cuon to a point where I crave it. Last night my gf and I tried out the other Banh Cuon place in our area. First impression is that look wise, it is better than the traditional Viet places in Toronto. The server immediately spoke to my gf in Viet which have made me think this must be authentic. After tasting their food, I have to say it is. Ironically enough, my gf had the <dish>Banh Cuon</dish> and I had <dish>pho</dish>. I know I will always get leftovers from her so I figure I'd order something else. Surprisingly, the pho was so traditional that it put me back having my first taste of pho at the bus station of Da Nang.  The broth was clean tasting and not so fatty like almost most I've had outside of Vietnam. You can tell that they remove the fat out of the broth. The meat was lean and the noodles were the skinny type. Quite tasty. I had some Banh Cuon from my gf and I think it is the best in Toronto. I used to love Phoga Banh Cuon, but I now have a new go to place. It was thinner, servings were better and the sides were tastier. It was closest to authentic I've had. My only issue is the <dish>spring roll</dish> that we ordered. It was oily and not so tasty so stay away from it. I also had a sinh to which I thought was a great way to end the meal.",1

7QXbCdmyDFHFK_cbG4TPVQ,"I moved in June 4 2018. Ashley is very nice, but that does not take away from all the terrible things about this apartment.  1) It took at least 3 work requests, several emails/calls to Ashley to get everything fixed that was wrong with the apartment when I moved in. It was finally taken care of in August (2 months after move in).  2) While I was at work, a new office lady, Shelly, walked in my apartment. My kids were home with their babysitter. When I got home they were scared. They told me how some lady opened the door then backed out without saying anything. I asked how she looked and was dressed then spoke to neighbors to find out it was office staff. I then called the office. This is when Shelly admitted it was her as she thought my apartment was not leased (I have lived here 2 months) and was trying to show it. She stated \I didn't think to\"" when asked why she didn't at least tell the kids who she was or call me and let me know it happened. She then got an attitude as I tried to explain why this was a big deal. She passed the phone off to Ashley stating \""I can't.\"" To this day, every interaction with her is unpleasant. She is rude, disrespectful, and condescending. Last week, when I went to inquire about the pool (see number 3), she interrupted her co-worker by talking over her, off topic, with her tone of voice that is very rude. When I asked her not to speak to me, she did a sarcastic laugh. But thankfully, quit talking and let her co-worker finish speaking.  3) The pool has been closed more than open. This is a huge deal for us. Paying to use a pool on a regular basis for me and my three children gets costly. My daughter is a competitive swimmer and needs to be in the pool daily practicing. This isn't fair given that I entered a lease with an apartment that has a swimming pool. Currently, this is the third weekend in a row that it has been closed. It was closed at least twice during July for a few days to a week at a time. Each time, it seems to be closed due to gate issues. You'd think they'd fix it. Shelly tried to have an attitude and blame this on the city stating they make the decision. However, I had to point out that although the city makes the call, the apartment complex knows the rules and it is up to them to make sure they are in compliance. If they were in compliance, the city would have no reason to close them down.  4) When it is brought to their attention about how they are not upholding their end of the lease, the excuse is always that they are short staff and run more than one property. I wish I could skip rent with the same reason. 5) They do not take care of their property. After I moved in, the trash can for dog poo near my place didn't get changed for over a month. It wasn't until I sent a picture of the overflow at the end of July that they finally changed it. I saw another review stating they have dog poo bags everywhere.This is true that they have stations for them, but they are always empty and have been since I moved in. The tennis courts and basketball courts have been abandoned and are not allowed to be used. People do not clean up after their dogs. I've even found dog poo on the sidewalks.  6) Good luck getting ahold of the office. On several occasions I came in around 5:30 after work. They were closed each time despite saying they are open until 6. They rarely answer the phone and do not return voicemails stating they never get them.  7) It's not safe to be out at night given there is no lighting.I have to take a flash light to walk my dog. 8) Carports have roofs that are falling apart.  9) You can only use the gym when the staff is present at the office which is rare.  10) I won't even go into all the details the shady-ness of when they towed cars for redoing the pavement. They claim they put notices on doors a week ahead. I personally did not get a notice until the night before (literally a 12 hour notice) that had the wrong date on it and no map so I find it hard to believe those who got towed were really notified.  11) Try to contact PSDM (corporate) they forward your web requests and emails to Ashley. Tried to contact them on FB too. They asked for my number and promised to call. It's been a week and no call. 12) They want over $3k to break a lease."""

7Tcw1RFvPXgtjJfbOxf4hw,"Brought my son in for a haircut. This was, quite honestly,  the FIRST time anyone cut his hair exactly how he wanted it. We've shown photos of what he wanted to so many stylists, but no one ever got it right.  Walked in at 9:01 and out the door by 9:29. This price was ridiculously low for what you are getting. Rich cut his hair with precision.  Every time I thought he was done he pulled out another tool and cleaned it up even more. This was the best haircut I've ever had the pleasure of watching and my son is super stoked.  We will never go anywhere else.   If you want an old fashioned barbershop cut from someone who knows what he is doing, go see Rich. This place is an A+ joint."
7UGEWXMUFATYuD7zK1f-TQ,"very nice place, however I was highly disappointed when I received my pedi.  I want to relax when I go to the salon and they had the TV up really loud and the stero going at the same time...they were busy so my nail tech kept getting up and leaving me just sitting there and ended up rushing through my pedi...on the up side, I was happy with how my nails turned out"
7UiHqd4EwgWJcZGrsn-4gA,"I went in skeptical because I have been to about 15 different nail salons in Phoenix, Chandler, Gilbert, Ahwatukee, Laveen and Avondale. I will travel for great service and great work. I called and got an appointment right away. I went in and I was immediately greeted by friendly staff. Ming came and showed me the gel colors and I picked the ones I wanted. I showed him a Google picture of something I was thinking of and he said he could make the magic happen. I again was a little skeptical cause I haven't really liked my nails in a really long time. Well when he got started he asked where I've been and I told him about all the salons I went to. He said to only come back to him and he would take great care of me. I waited until I saw the finished nails before paint before I made my mind up. They really looked great. Perfectly shaped and no weird curves or thick spots. When he did the design I have to admit I got a little giddy. I got about 10 compliments on my nails yesterday even from guys. I was through the moon. Ming your the only one for me now. :)"

I'd think that's kind of a bad idea, what with grab & go shoplifting and all, but hey... it's not like Tempe Marketplace is an example of great planning, anyway.  I feel kinda guilty for frequenting a chain when we have such cool local bookstores (Changing Hands, Ash Ave. Comics), but: 1. My boyfriend works here, I like to stop by and see him. Awwwww. 2. They're open later than Changing hands (11pm), and they have better seating... conveniently located next to the graphic novel section. 3.

7_h1D46AgX2YqZ9aKmx-Ag,"I wish I could rate this place 0 stars and I did not even have an opportunity to try their product.  I approached their stand at a street fair and watched them making liquid nitrogen desserts.  The person in front of me asked for a flavor (the same one I was going to order) and the man made it, filled a heaping bowl of the dessert, and gave it to the customer.  Looked delicious.  I order the same flavor.  The man looks into the bowl and sees that there is not enough, and says \I will make some fresh for you.\""  Good, that is the point of your whole gimmick, right?  He then looks around for things, looks up at the number of people, and begins scraping the bottom of the mixing bowl from the last batch.  He takes out the mixer and scrapes it off, really pulling from the dregs.  He then manages to fill the cup 3/4 (which is maybe less than half of what he gave the person ahead of me) and tries to hand it to me.  While he was doing this I asked if he was going so still make it fresh, he ignored me.    That's pretty lousy, but here is the bad part.  He tried to push this yogurt on me and acted incredulous that I was not going to pay for that crap.  I wasn't even going to take it from his hands.  I had to suffer the embarrassment, in front of people I was wish, of this whole ordeal.  Buying <dish>frozen yogurt</dish> should not be so complicated.

7dWvX7P7CcVBfvtTcHTP6w,"Tonya is the quintessential event/lifestyle photographer. She knows how to capture each moment with energy and flair.  We met Tonya when we were looking for a wedding photographer. I was adamant about NOT wanting engagement shots - just wanted the small, simple ceremony recorded for posterity, etc. But Tonya talked us into having engagement shots, much to my trepidation. I'm not exactly modelesque, and tend to have an abundance of awkward photos of myself. I don't even smile properly in photos, so I was less than enthusiastic about posing and having to look \cute.\""  Oh Tonya...allaying my many fears, she photographed her way into my heart and we ended up with brilliant engagement shots in which our quirkiness and relationship shined. One of the reasons she prescribed an engagement shoot for us was so she would be able to get comfortable with us (and vice versa), and to see if there were any super weird aspects to our aesthetic that she would have to address when shooting the wedding.  When it came to the wedding itself, she was totally in the mix with the crowd, capturing photos of our many friends, family and (yes, really) wedding crashers. Her professionalism is matched by her effusive personality, and she brings out the party in everyone.  We had an incredible experience with Tonya and recommend her to anyone who even mentions getting married or needing event photography.

7kzQjGmeI0Z1q06q_aE1PQ,"I stopped back into this place to give it another try. I was more impressed on my second visit.   The coffee options alone are enough to draw me in. I enjoyed a <dish>Pecan Pie Latte</dish> which was delicious. This was the perfect decadent afternoon treat. I also ordered the <dish>Monster Cookie</dish> which had a nice mix of peanut butter, chocolate, and oats. Lots of flavor and deliciousness. Since I'm very benevolent I ordered the <dish>Pumpkin Cheesecake</dish> to take home to my husband. This was the main event. The cheesecake flavor was great and then they took it to the next level with a brown sugar based crust. I really enjoyed the cheesecake and was telling coworkers every detail about it the next day.  As I was checking out I noticed that they have packed cookies and chocolate covered pretzels. The <dish>chocolate covered pretzels</dish> were perfect to pair with a giftcard for a Christmas gift I was delivering the next day. Sweet treats for me and checking gifts off my list.",1
7lNFXLUNzbRKKJR01G1Hdg,"This place although completely unassuming from the outside and almost hidden from the main drag,Bell Rd.. It surprised me once inside!  Great food, cocktails & service!  I only give it the 3 stars for now because the ambiance is lacking a bit. I was there with three others and we basically were the only customers all evening!  Craziness. The place is nicely decorated (bordering on gawdy) but still,. Nice-ish. The owner came by to see how we were doing and to invite us back on a Saturday night, they apparently have belly dancers and dj music for late night dancing. I'll go back for that and re-evaluate my review then. Hope I can give them more stars..   We shall see: TBA! Xo",1

There were lots of cute little free activities there, like building a birdhouse, or painting a little planter.  The kids really enjoyed those, as well as the little outdoor garden.  The staff was really friendly.  The place was generally quiet, easy-going and kind of empty.  Also, strangely, there is a huge display of frog sculptures.  I'm really not sure I get that..."

But very tasty. Good job guys!",1
7nv7W2ZaY8BJ9KZ-xF5vYQ,Had to find something to do for the afternoon and went to this based on the reviews I read. Very pleased with the experience. The actors were wonderful and set the perfect ambiance. My only negative was the Making of the Godfather movie. It was too long and needs to be edited down to a little 15 minute clip. I would recommend this to someone whe needs a break from the casinos.

The <dish>Italian wedding soup</dish> was well prepared as was the <dish>insalata della casa</dish>.  The <dish>mac and cheese</dish> ordered by my grand daughter was really good as was the <dish>roasted vegetable pasta</dish> ordered by the other grand daughter.

However, I was very awkwardly greeted by a man who made me feel as if I was out of line for even walking through the door. I explained to him that I had set up a time to tour the venue and would like to talk with the person I had set it up with. He very coldly responded with, this is it. I asked if it was okay if I took a look around as he didn't initiate a tour. He said, sure. His responses were cold, short and again I clearly was inconveniencing him. It took me a whole 5 minutes to determine this was NOT the place for me. It's too bad. The venue is very pretty. I cringed at the thought of working with this man to bring my big day together. I would highly recommend they invest in someone who is warm, cares and can at least give the impression that they like what they do."
7p54EUi6PylEtmSyMdIstA,"Came here on a weekend night around 9.30pm and there were still plenty of tables left and got a table for 5 right away. The decor is nice, feels modern, spacious with high ceilings.   My friends and I saw the cute sugar orb that was going around social media and we wanted to try it but it was $30! Which is way too overpriced! So we decided not to get it and try other things instead. I got the <dish>coconut, mango chai seed slush</dish>. It was pretty to look at but the taste was bland. No mango or coconut flavor, and there was just too many chia seeds, I mean I love chia seeds but theirs had a grassy note to them which made it slightly unpleasant. It was not good and not worth almost $8.   My friend got the <dish>mango sticky rice</dish>, again he said it was flavorless and it was more ice than anything else and the portion was quite small. Our other friends were also not impressed with their orders including the <dish>mango crepe cake</dish>, and <dish>mango sago</dish>.   We did sit there for a few hours and no one kicked us out which was nice, so its a good place to catch up but seriously...just go somewhere else and don't believe the hype =(",1

Food is not cooked temperature no longer be coming here...,1
7rpa12_EX3A-hyGtrv8o3A,"We saw this place on tv and wanted to try it out. We weren't disappointed with the food, very enjoyable and tasty, but the service was poor. The waitress would have to had to try very hard to have paid less attention to our table. I think it took 4 askings and about 25 minutes to get our bill after first requesting. Had they been busier I imagine they might have been in more of a hurry to take our money.",1

Dried food on the silverware, glasses & plates, last time the water tasted heavy of soap (at least they are using soap I guess).  I finally gave up & tried their new location in Mesa, same problem but not to the same extent.  Must be something in the management; they can't train or hire decent dish washers.",1

7u0DEiUxTO3rAJ7C8ak46Q,I got an industrial piercing by Dana and he was awesome! All I have to say is this place is crazy sanitary and had a wide variety of jewelry to choose from. I love love love my piercing and Dana was very informative in explaining aftercare and how to clean it. So glad I came in there later at night because there was no wait and I was pierced within ten minutes of walking in there. I was pretty nervous but Dana was really funny and took my mind off the piercing. I'll be returning soon...:) I highly recommend this place.

While I didn't see any servers approaching the small sitting area, the bartenders did a good job at keeping the crowds pleased.

7w4oNrilYRud98R-qwohCg,"my wife got us 2 tickets for this show that toured past Glendale last night. The most i've ever known about TSO is the christmas song they play at ZooLights to the dancing light trees. But apparently the band actually plays other music and has vocals! i guess you learn something everyday.   i was a little suprised and pleased at first...the show, replete with every member donning long, flowing locks of hair, reminded me of my days as a concert go-er at Poison, Motley Crue, etc. Screaming guitar solos, gigantic drum sets, tight leather pants, crunching melodics, all that shit that made you love 80's rock.   plus, it is a light show, pyrotechnic show, moving stage show, laser show EXTRAVAGANZA! i was ooohhh-ing and ahhhhh-ing throughout the show. and they really, really, really put on a good show....even an electric violin player!   an incredible Prog Rock Christmas metal show....of course not for everyone, and if the little lady hadn't gotten the tickets, i never would've considered TSO as a concert. but i liked them alot."

7wLpx3PUW9JSt_RnDuBwxw,"Picking up someone from the airport makes me anxious. Maybe it's because I don't trust anyone on the road lol. Driving to the airport, trying to navigate around the sometimes confusing signs to where you are supposed to meet while dodging the already crazy and frantic drivers, especially during rush hour argh! I'm glad that there are cell phone lots to make it a little easier to wait for your person's flight to arrive, and 3 of them too!   I meant to go to the closest lot from 24th Street but I accidentally made a wrong turn when the road forked so I ended up at the more centrally located one which was alright in the end. There were plenty of spots and the screens showing the flight times is a nice little perk. Getting out of the lot was easy and while it was still a bit stressful getting to the right gate, with enough careful driving and some accompanying occasional but rapid cursing my passenger was picked up safe and sound, we were on our way out of Sky Harbor and onto better and brighter things!"

Die Preise sind natürlich nicht ohne, so isst man zu zweit mal locker für 125 Dollar (inkl. dem üblichen Trinkgeldsatz von mind. 15%) und wir hatten auch keine Weinflasche oder einen Cocktail auf dem Tisch.

7yVp8g16IjOLNY5F_IexKw,"At later dinner on a Friday night... the place was very dirty (floors), but I figured they must have had a heck of an earlier service, so I was encouraged that they have a good following.  I ordered <dish>fried flounder</dish> and <dish>french fries</dish>, with a side of slaw.  The fish was fishy and the batter was so hard, I could't cut it with my fork!!!  The fries were fishy, too! EW!  Hubby got <dish>chicken and dumplings</dish>.  It was salty and slimy with very little chicken (both in quantity and size of chunks, they weren't chunks, really).  Son got a giant <dish>burger</dish>, and it satisfied him.  I tried a bite, it seemed like a GFS frozen patty, to accompany his GFS french fries.  Overall impression, this is a re-heat and serve place, which is how they can offer the cheap pricing that they do... not that they buy wholesome fresh base items, that aren't expensive to begin with, and cook those.  If this is fresh cooking, then this is an alternate universe, where everything is backwards.",1
7z2x16M7IuG8KPfMsyVrKA,"Top five meals of my life. Hands down.  Based on reviews and word of mouth, my husband and I chose <restaurant>Morcilla</restaurant> to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. It was difficult to get a later <occasion>dinner</occasion> reservation, but we were very pleased with a 4:15 seating. Upon arrival the restaurant was rather quiet (this changed as our visit continued which was the only draw back for me). To start, my husband had a <dish>beer</dish> and I had a <dish>Gin & Tonic</dish> with one of the lovely gins Morcilla offers. I loved the presentation of my drink with fruit, rosemary, and star anise! As for food, we tried the <dish>oxtail</dish>, <dish>chorizo</dish>, <dish>sobrasada</dish>, and the <dish>pigs feet and cheek croqueta</dish>. All of which were fantastic, but for me the sobrasada and oxtail were the home runs. Tip: if you're sharing, order two oxtail. You're really not going to want to share. Finally, we ordered two plates: the <dish>Cordero en Moreno (lamb meatballs)</dish> and the <dish>Pulpo Escabeche (octopus)</dish>. Both were perfection. The octopus was tender and delicious, and the meatballs were unique and fantastic. Aside from the increasing noise level as our visit wore on, were beyond pleased with our visit to Morcilla. Remember this is a tapas and small plates restaurant- you're not going to find a huge entree here. With that said, we spent $88 on three alcoholic beverages, after dinner espresso, and enough food that we certainly didn't leave hungry. To me, that's a pretty fair price for a restaurant at this level!",1

Check them out on the Better Business Bureau - also horrible.    I'm not reviewing this company because they damaged or stole my belongings (which they did) I'm reviewing them based on their shady practices and awful service.  Assurance Van Lines (also a carrier to avoid) brokered my move to this carrier Executive Moving And Storage. What ensued is a nightmare that has literally lasted over 1 yr (my move was 3/31/17. Today is 4/13/18 and I'm still dealing with it).  FRAUD They're fraudulent and significantly overcharged me for cubic feet that didn't exist, damaged and stole my belonging.  Yes, you read that correctly. This carrier fraudulently overcharged me almost $500 for literally made up cubic feet - for which I have proof. I was quoted for 350 cubic feet, my actual belongings measured out exactly (with a tape measure) to less than 250 cubic feet. This carrier arrived end of the day on my move out day and lied and said that I had well over 500 cubic feet and he was going to leave me there if I didn't pay the extra $500. I had no choice but to let him load my stuff (as my lease was ending in a few hours) and my flight to my new state was booked for the following morning. My boyfriend who was present is literally in transportation and knows all about the weight and size of freight and knew I was spot on.  In casual conversation with the guys loading my stuff out of the apartment one of them told me that the company was totally shady and that next time I should book with another carrier he recommended.  DELAYED DELIVERY & LIMITED CORRESPONDENCE  They held my belongings in storage well past the agreed upon timeframe without notice - I had to try to track them down constantly to know when I'd receive my stuff.   DAMAGE & LOSS Of course they damaged many of my belongings and at least one item never arrived (my box spring). How on earth do you \lose\"" a box spring.  REFUSE TO PAY CLAIM I followed the proper protocol and filed a claim for the damage and lost item through CSI (their also shady and poorly rated Better Business Bureau \""claims\"" company). They awarded me an amount in Sept 2017. Payment was due 45 days later in Nov 2017. It's Apr 2018 and my emails have gone unanswered and I've called multiple times each time being told that the claims person isn't in until Thursday (Tiffany) and will call me back. Never had a call back. Not one.  Whatever you do do NOT use this carrier. Spread the word. This has been a nightmare. Trust the literally hundreds of other ppl who've rated them with 1 Star."""

Also nice to see a family run restaurant who's keeping it real with the restaurant name. When it comes to Pho'Q and Pho'U - I'm Not so sure.... but one thing I do know - this joint is Pho Real. Always busy - but never too long a wait. Get over there! It's about 'Tai-m. I will be 'Bac !  After your meal - Don't forget to order an <dish>iced Vietnamese coffee</dish> to go. BOMB",1

8LNrYqpsGlgRRpEiq9JWGg,"though it was easy to use Levelup to order from nearby restaurants. however, their customer support leaves a lot to be desired.  i ordered a takeout today from a thai restaurant. while the receipt from levelup was $24.77, the actual receipt from the restaurant was $20.40. i immediately emailed levelup and the agent confirmed the prices at levelup was wrong due to bad data and that he would issue a global credit. since i was not sure what he meant by 'global credit', i replied asking the credit to be refunded back to my credit card.  a second agent replied saying 'he was not sure he could issue the credit'...seriously???  they admitted they made a mistake with the pricing and now they are telling me they are unable to issue the credit different back to my credit card?  that seems rather lame, let alone acceptable.   i am writing this to warm other potential customers who may use their service to order from restaurant if they refuse to make the proper adjustment due to their own mistake.  i know i will not be ordering thru them going forward"
8LOFhRnSKoNlVKmDRLS2mQ,"Got a pedicure. The price was on the low side, for Cleveland--would have been $5-10 LESS in San Francisco, which is the funny thing about Cleveland nail salons... But I was able to walk in and I waited less than 10 minutes to be seen even though it was pretty busy. It seemed like the tech was doing an average job during the service, although I was reading so I wasn't paying very close attention. Unfortunately, the pedicure started chipping within the week. That's pretty unusual for me; even when I do my own toes, they usually look good for at least 10 days, and in my experience a good salon pedicure typically looks good for a few weeks. I'm pretty bummed about it, I was all excited to find a salon in Cleveland that did pedicures for a reasonable price. :( Looks like I'm still on the hunt!"

8PCFk6ZKDm73Ag42C8XtGw,"They just opened this week. We ordered <dish>papri chaat</dish>, <dish>aloo chat</dish> and <dish>chole bhatura</dish>. It was a to go order. They had sufficient seating, the service was a little slow but I can understand them being in their first week of opening. The place has open seating, order on your own and they bring your food to the table. The prices are very reasonable. They open from 10am to 10 pm.   I enjoyed Chole bhatura the most. The chole was real good. Something I would love to come again to try. The chaat had the sauces mixed before hand for a take out order which soaked the papri too much. It would have been much better if they had separately the sauce. In all, this is a good place to try different varieties of Indian street food.  Give it a try... you might have to come prepared to wait for a little for your food to come out.",1

8R7l4_QO1JVBDNJLUaRDWw,"Nous avons vu Café Bloom pour la première fois lors d'une course dans le coin. C'est un petit café comme on pourrait trouver sur le plateau, mais en plein coeur de Pointe St-Charles.  À première vue, vous pourrez voir un assemblement de chaises et tables différentes avec un petit look vintage ou juste vieux. On peut dire que ça fait rétro. En plus, y'avait de l'art sur les murs. Une des différences des petits brunchs du genre sur le plateau : il y avait de la place! On était pas crampé dans une petite pièce, on a de la place.  Le choix du menu est assez simple, il y avait 8 choix différents environ, variant de 7 à 11$. C'est un menu de brunch assez normal je dirais avec des bons choix santé / végé.   J'ai pris le bol Bloom. C'est un bol rempli de bonnes choses comme : du quinoa, du kale, des courges, du chou et un oeuf et avec une petite sauce à mettre par dessus. Ça me fait vraiment penser aux bols qu'on peut trouver chez Aux Vivres.  C'était bien bon. Avec le quinoa qui enveloppe le tout, je peux dire que c'était assez (même si j'ai fini l'assiette de ma blonde).  Fauve a décidé de prendre l'assiette brunch. Vous pouvez y trouver ce que vous trouvez dans tous les brunchs : bacon, saucisse, oeufs, petite confiture fraise-rhubarbe maison, patates et bines.  C'est avec plaisir que j'y retournerai. Bon rapport qualité/prix."

8UMFvFWmSpfl8JZ_jm1K3A,"Our gripe with Blue Dog Rv is very similar to every single 1 star rating review on yelp. We bought a new 5th wheel toy hauler from them. When we took it camping, we discovered what a piece of junk it was. Our old 5th wheel, purchased used, was in better shape than the thing we bought from Blue Dog. Grey tank and black tank labels were mislabeled. A/C didn't work. Shower leaked water all over the floor causing the flooring to bubble up. Screws popped out all over the place. Maybe this is normal for a brand new 5th wheel? If it is I might as well have bought used. Then to top it off I hear my husband talking to the service department and what a joke....sounded very unorganized and disheveled. They are overworked and can't keep up with the demand of service. Overall I am unsatisfied with this store and do not recommend them to anyone."
8WBHKj2davW6hhZWlUQ7DA,"A good view from anywhere in the theater.  I had the pit/floor tickets. Spacious spot. Crowded only at the front of the stage but towards the back of the pit there was plenty of room to stand with space or to lean against the wall. I appreciate that there were friendly & discreet security walking around in the pit to ensure everyone was having a good time without endangering others or themselves.   Place cleared out pretty quickly. Very minimal cell service but you could log in to their free wifi. The theater does NOT allow cameras with interchangeable lens. Even if you only have one lens and a non-zoom lens. Any camera in which the lens can be removed is considered a \professional camera\"" and is required to be checked-in and retrieved at the end of the show.   Buy drinks before going into the theater. There's only two full bar areas in the theater that I saw. Luckily, there is a bar right outside the entrance that has the Vegas club feel to it, but it does get busy before and after shows."""

On y sert une sélection variée de sandwichs au fromage pressés (les fameux grilled cheese). Le local archi-exigu a de quoi donner des misères si vous avez dans l'intention d'y travailler longtemps. Le dernier siège au fond du local encombré pourrait presque vous occasionner un accès de claustrophobie. Au bout d'une heure, il règne entre les clients une sorte de complicité due à une proximité de catégorie \"" ascenseur \"". Mais en réalité, le café qu'on y fait dans les règles de l'art vaudra bien vos peines. Le miens était excellent et me vaudra certainement une autre visite. En été, asseyez vous à l'extérieur, les deux bancs permettent de profiter bien mieux de l'ambiance du quartier.  Le seul mystère demeure le prix des fameux sandwichs. La qualité de celui que j'ai goûté s'élevait bien un peu au dessus de ce que je me serais fait à la maison, mais je ne crois pas que tout le monde serait prêt à ouvrir aussi grand les rebords de leur bourse pour les payer. Alors comment Lapin parvient-il à survivre dans ces conditions? Probablement grâce à la clientèle fidèle de ce coin de quartier charmant, en retrait du \"" Plateau \"".   Profitez-en en pour parcourir le Parc Wilfrid-Laurier à deux pas, ou encore filer vers l'Est sur Laurier jusqu'à l'avenue Papineau, question d'entrer dans les quelques petites boutiques peu fréquentées.

It's situated a little tucked back from the other bars and restaurants in the area, but don't worry the place is great!   Most of the games, with exception to ping pong, air hockey and skeet ball, are free. It mostly consists of your classic throwback games from the 80s, but they had a great mix. The games to people ratio on a Saturday afternoon was good, as it wasn't too busy. We didn't have to fight or wait for any games of our choice.   Lastly, they had a good selections of beers and cocktails - along with daily drink specials so make sure you ask about them.",1
8Zqh2jwtncA3N4fWEMTvZQ,"I tried <restaurant>Scramble</restaurant> because they were one of the sponsors for the St Mary's canned food drive. It looked as if they had turned over the whole place for the drive, even offered a 2 for 1meal  ticket for people who made canned goods donations. I always feel rushed when you have to order at the cashier station but the gal who took the orders was patient and very nice.  I order the <dish>mushroom, bacon and jack cheese omelette</dish>, it was presented nicely with rosemary potatoes and toast. Toast was burned but replaced quickly. My mister ordered a <dish>BLT with Applewood bacon on a fresh baquette</dish>. Standard fare, but  well done.  <dish>American coffee</dish> was excellent.

I also like that they use local markets and farmers.   It was very clean and the patio looked inviting.",1
8bZ49zy4KlFVu5teFETYhQ,"This place gets 2 out of 5 only because the food is good here. However, the service is absolutely horrible. The six of us went here to try it out since our usual place has went down hill. The pricing is very good, although they don't have any all you can eat. Most of the rolls are half price! We all ordered about 5 minutes after getting here...keep this in mind. After about 30 minutes, our first <dish>rolls</dish> began to arrive. We did not see our server for this entire time. And we each got one roll. By the time we finished our first rolls, our second rolls began to arrive, which was fine. But 2 of us at the table ordered <dish>chicken teriyaki bowls</dish>, and 40 minutes in, they had yet to be seen.  So the two of them sat there with no food for this whole time so far.   At the hour mark, we finally mentioned something the next time we saw somebody, our server was still missing. They said sorry, and that none were being made as they didn't know they were ordered. After being here for about an hour and 15 minutes, finally they brought out the bowls, but one was chicken and one was beef (Again wrong). We didn't want to deal with it, so we just ate that. They also forgot two of our rolls that we ordered and had to bring it up. Throughout the entire service, our server was seen only once or twice, and that was mostly towards the end. We waited long wait times for refills on drinks, and someone at our table who ordered the \meal\"" didn't receive the soup or desert promised as a part of the meal. When we got our check, we were amazed to see that they had added 18% gratuity automatically, when we hadn't seen our server at all the whole time. We complained and they took the tip off, and another 10% off the bill for the troubles. The manager was nice about it and seemed sincerely sorry.   While we were there, one of the other tables just got up and left before getting their food. And the table behind us was receiving the wrong items. This place needs to get their act together, or they won't be in business long. The food tastes great, but we will not be returning due to the horrible service.""",1

They werent crispy, but the flavor was very good. The <dish>pancetta</dish> that came next with them was excellent. The wine pour was small. Although they have a nice selection of wines.

We have sampled the <dish>beef and bison patties</dish>, as well as the <dish>bacon wrapped cheese dogs</dish>, and all are fantastic and as healthy as meat gets!  :-) The <dish>grass-fed beef burgers</dish> are my personal favorite, and I am equally fond of the <dish>regular fries</dish> and the <dish>sweet potato fries</dish> (don't forget that cinnamon sugar!)  We are also delighted with the new additions of milkshakes, root beer floats, and Boylan's sodas - fantastic to enjoy pop without the high fructose corn syrup when dining out! :-)  Some of the menu items are admittedly a little pricier than other places - but I feel I am paying for quality and unique options, so I am ok with that.  We have sometimes experienced  the service to be a little slow, but other times it was quite fast - given that everything is cooked fresh and to order.  Again - I don't mind waiting a bit for that. (Being able to walk into a place and leave with a burger and fries within a minute or two - well, the food \""quality\"" is going to reflect that...)

8nuvHKCDRrGjmm5c1gUnRw,"Used this location on Monday, everything went pretty well.  I paid for the truck in cash so you have to leave $100 deposit and they needed 6 references that had to answer the phone when they called.  Now because I rented the truck at basically 8am there were certain contacts that I had to wake up to make sure they were available to answer the phone.  If you use this location make sure you bring the truck back at the proper fuel level and that the back of the cab is thoroughly swept cleaned or they will charge you a cleaning fee.  The only really thing I didn't like besides having to wake my references up was when I was backing out to leave after I returned the truck one of the employees was speeding through the parking lot like a maniac and almost hit my car which is why I listed them at 4 stars instead of 5.  I would definitely use them in the future because I'm hoping the crazy driving employee incident was an isolated issue and not something that happens every single day."

We have called on several occasions after hours begging for someone to return our phone calls because our child has severe asthma issues... We have been told multiple times we would get a call back, and we never did! If you need refills because you're out-don't plan on them going the extra mile to call them in. They will not do anything after hours or on the weekend. I am not used to people treating patients that way. I know that they get calls all the time, but I feel like that is part of the job description. As a parent, it is scary when your kid is not well. You need someone in your corner. It is not this practice. I am not going back. Something must have changed because the reviews were once positive- they are becoming negative on here and google.

We order the <dish>Chicken Katsu</dish> (as recommended by Nelson Q.) and<dish> Honolulu special</dish>. Both were just kind of blah. The Katsu had a good breading, but no flavor to it at all and the sauce for it had some odd taste to it.  The Honolulu special had no special taste to it either, so it definitely needed the drenching of sauce that came with it. The service was kind bad too because it took awhile for my friend's water to get refilled and they honestly didn't look that busy because there was only 2 other parties there. The ambiance of the restaurant didn't add to it either considering it probably use to be a Mexican restaurant. As much as I like to support local businesses, this place is a no go for me.

There is a bit of bar seating but tons of tables so you'll definitely get a seat no matter what day/time it is - even on weekends!

It's assorted so you always get a good mix of various kinds of fish, even if you order the smallest platter. The fish has always been delicious and I really like the mix of seared or seaweed wrapped sashimi along side the usual salmon and tuna.   - <dish>Okonomiyaki</dish> (without toppings) - Delicious! But takes a while to get to the table, it's always last to come out when we order it.  - <dish>Salmon Tataki</dish> - This dish is comparable to Guu but just without the garlic chips and some greens instead. So good!  - <dish>Grilled Buttered Squid</dish> - Grilled to perfection and not overcooked. It comes with a sweet/spicy korean like sauce.  - <dish>Black Cod</dish> - SOOOOO creamy! A must get!  - <dish>Oysters</dish>!! They charge a fair price for the kind of oysters they usually have which is either Beach Angels (West Coast) or Shigokus (Washington). It comes with a couple house-made sauces but they also have Tobasco if you prefer.  - <dish>Sake</dish> - they have a pretty good selection (in my limited knowledge) and I like that it comes with a \dry-ness\"" score on the menu so you have an idea of taste. The waitress also has good recommendations if you ask. We asked her the first time we went and have since always gotten the same one. Once you order the sake you also get to pick your cup from a basket of selections (so fun!).   What you do not come here to get: <dish>fries</dish>. My friend ordered them because he was starving and we were sorely disappointed in the quality (no kidding). I also tried the <dish>beer slush</dish> they have and found it underwhelming. Although I'm not really a beer drinker myself I was intrigued by the novelty. Also, I would recommend not getting the <dish>skewers</dish>. They were warm when they got to my table and teeny tiny, so not worth the price.   If you go late at night, around 11pm onwards if I remember correctly, they blast the music very loudly so expect to scream if you plan on chatting. This is not a place for late night intimate dates. They also play pretty good music (in my opinion haha.. lots of up to date edm!).Yuzu is a good place to kill time before hitting up a karaoke place, which is also conveniently located downstairs.   Tons of parking in the green P lot in the back or on the street.""",1
99KKeZYRPnz7qDi5USsHmw,"We ended up doing the powerplant tour because the Dam tour was not offered during our visit.    The Dam itself is breathtaking and impressive and certainly worth a visit.  As for the tour, meh. Interesting enough but not something I would ever do again and I don't think I'd recommend it. The movie at the beginning was probably the most interesting part and the views from outside are more impressive than what you see on the inside.  I would recommend you save your money, go watch a video or two on youtube about the hoover dam.   One legitimate complaint about the experience.  I'm native English speaker and could not understand about 50% of the tour guide's talk.  He had strange pronunciations, voice inflections and would mumble and slur his words together, particularly at the end of a segment."
99SN6hku1PToQ2E3-4h8CA,I'm not what you say someone who knows their coffee but I do drink it and I'm pretty picky. Hands down I love <restaurant>Jitters cafe</restaurant> I always get their <dish>cold brew coffee</dish>. It doesn't have that gross bitter taste to it! Honestly most other places I have to fill my cup up with half and half and their cold brew doesn't even need it! I hate going to chains but the only other coffee I can tolerate drinking is Starbucks! My husband and I enjoy going to different coffee shops in the area and this one is my absolute favorite! They also give you a card to hole punch and I think your tenth one is free!  I recommend stopping in and giving it a try!,1
9BBWtaSvsootDkKTVBgv_A,"This place was packed on Mother's Day! Service and food quality was good. Ambience, people and various food choices all together makes it outstanding. Also good for weekday lunch. I give 4 stars and give time to be the best in future.",1
9E1q2uEMd881wnruicNTUA,"I'm very particular about wings. The seasoning on the <dish>wings</dish> was delicious (lemon pepper on 1/2 and the \Asian Zing\"" sauce for the other half), but they were a skosh underdone (my fault for not requesting extra crispy, but nothing that can't be fixed in my oven at home). The waitress in the bar area was very nice and courteous, if not very attentive. I will probably return at some point, prices are reasonable. Love that they have so many screens to watch a variety of games. Today I was watching soccer and basketball.""",1
9EKJAK_Bt7POH2h9JzHhhw,FYI- This has nothing to do with the artists. I called a week before the day that my friend and I wanted to get tattooed. When I called I explained I wanted to set an appointment but was told the only way to do that was by stopping by with artwork and leaving a deposit. I said that we were from out of town and unable to just stop by. They told me that best way to do this would be walk in. Well that's what happened and they were unable to take us. I understand that things happen but I would have been more than happy to email my artwork and give a credit card deposit to hold the appointment but that was not offered. We called another shop and went down street.
9F0ZUAvU4aKkPKBs9HAs6g,"Well this is my local branch....again another locale within walking distance of my apt. My favorite aspect of this library is the self check out. I love how you can just let scan your card....place your items on the pad....the computer checks them out for you....and you receive your receipt. It is fast....easy....and you don't have to talk to anyone....not to mention there is great parking. My other favorite aspect of this branch is that you can put a hold on books if you have an online account with www.phxlib.org and when you materials are ready they will send you an email and you can go to your favorite branch and pick them up. This is a great service offered by the phoenix library system....and the customer service staff is very helpful when you come into the branch. They also have free Wi-Fi....computer access....all the latest CD's and DVD's and plenty of children and adult activities on a daily basis. So get out to your favorite branch and remember to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!"
9F7NTHmXRSY89IjeQ4-8Zg,"So I visit this store at least once a day while I am at work, sometimes twice a day, so I thought things could only get better........ I guess I couldn't have been more wrong :-/  So I have long since given up on them learning my name (at least at this store) and as for memorizing my drink, I guess that's certainly out of the question, because we all know how hard it is to remember a Grande black coffee!! I rarely order anything else, because when I do they always seem to get it wrong. For some reason this store can't seem to understand what you mean when you order \non-fat\"" and then when you correct them on it, they get upset that they have to remake your drink.  But today was the creme de la creme of crappiness at this location! I went in and ordered my usual <dish>Grande black coffee</dish>, and the barista told me that they didn't have any brewed, so he started brewing some and then charged me the $2.11. He then proceeded to help the next few people in line and of course he completely forgot about my coffee. So about 10 minutes later I went back up to the counter and asked if my coffee was ready and he said \""oh yeah\"" and he poured my coffee and then instead of giving me my coffee, he proceeded to to walk over to another barista and have a random chat with her while holding my coffee?! When he finally did make his way to the counter, I grabbed my coffee and started to walk out. It was at that point he began talking to the other baristas and the people in line about how I didn't pay for my coffee!!!  Was he actually serious!! I only wished he hadn't wasted my whole entire lunch break waiting for my coffee because I would have tore into him!  Dear tall barista at <restaurant>Sbux</restaurant> thanks for being such a jerk today and ruining my lunch break!  WORST SBUX EVER!!!""",1
9FPEg18SyYsKgbWZ0XDysQ,"Stopped by <dish>Carolina Cones</dish> on my way home from the Y (shhhhhh don't tell!).  Actually, I purchased ice cream for the little one but I did have a taste.  She had a <dish>cotton candy and oreo cone</dish> in a cup.  Needless to say, she was excited.  I tasted the cotton candy and yes, it tasted like the gooey treat you often get at Carowinds or a street fair.  It was pretty tasty.  I will have to make a special trip to Carolina Cones when I am not visiting the gym.  The place has plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors.  I suppose on a weekend evening, it may get pretty crowded."
9GfFdsfxouvrm_Www0sgkg,"Went early  to North for the New Year's eve special menu. 3rd time dining here. They did not have to have great service or food on a yearly event, but as with the previous meals, it was outstanding. Hubby had the <dish>misto fritto</dish>, they always do the crisp calamari perfect. Enough just to make a special trip for it. I had the <dish>beef carpaccio</dish>, buttery and flavorful. The <dish>apple cider pork tenderloin</dish> was tender, moist and it was a huge portion. My hubby was stuffed but did not stop eating until it was all gone. Oink. I had the <dish>scallops</dish>. Always a favorite of mine. They usually have it on the menu and often in a variation as a special. We both had the <dish>hazelnut chocolate cake</dish>. Sinfully rich. We were both too full to eat but a bite and finished at home for the New Year's countdown.  We really enjoy our dining at North and have been very fortunate at several other Fox restaurants."
9GxojoTIslVmALOukVr6mg,"Came here today for a gel manicure, since the place i normally go to was closed.   The place seemed decent, clean and relaxing, but the prices were cheap. The service kind of reflected it as well.   The guy did a good job for the most part, but he didn't put enough of the gel coating on so my nails aren't are strong as they are when i get them done at my usual place. Not to mentioned when i got home, part of the gel on one of my thumb nails chipped....Um, i thought that's why i just paid $20 for this type of manicure?  Anyway, if i needed a place quickly b/c i couldn't get into my normal place i'd go back as a last resort.  Most definitely not my first choice.  Summary: **If you don't get your nails done regularly, and you're 'just looking for a place' to get a quick mani-pedi at a cheap price, this is a great place. If you're picky like me and invest a lot of time/money getting your nails/toes done, go elsewhere....you'll be happy you did**"

9HdEvvISPbzbL1u0wGJHrg,"Kind of on the fence about this place....  I like the atmosphere, and their <dish>beer</dish> is cold and well served...  But the service is not always good.  I've found that the wait for them to take your credit card here is insanely long.  Also I've tried their food, which I describe as okay. The pizza bites were fine, but they're something I could whip up in 10 minutes at home. Their <dish>wings</dish> are okay, but aren't quite as crisp as I'd like.  I understand that they're marinated and baked, but perhaps baking them a bit longer or flipping them more often would lead to a more uniform-crispness.  My order was soggy in several places.",1
9IJ-TE4HEcAJQkUtc1A_Vw,Food was excellent BUT our WAITRESS was even BETTER! She was so sweet. So attentive and very knowledgeable of all their dishes.

9IdMkeSBwvaCmtl3opdcUw,"Awesome experience! Feels weird to say that about buying a car, but it's true. I had my last car 13 years!!! Half the reason was bc of the hassle of buying a new one!!! Finally had to do went to ABS and was in and out with a new car in 2.5 hours including just walking around looking at cars. I had no idea what I wanted and these guys were super nice showed me cars that had a few bells and whistles I was looking for. Decided on a Mazda CX-9 and and very happy with my purchase. Start to finish these guys were great. They listened they followed through on things they promised and just a real great experience I've already referred 2 friends and I'd happily refer more.

Amazing selection of everything from bags to guides and if they don't have it they will order it and get it to you ASAP. They have great prices and give discounts if you buy in bulk or military which is always nice to be appreciated! The number one thing that I love about DRS is that they open earlier than any other store and have EVERYTHING you would ever need or want!!!

9WOPUTu7NnVvYhcpdbrgxA,"Ordered delivery on a Saturday night just before 7pm. Person on the other line was pleasant and informed us it would take 45 minutes. Starving, we ordered:  <dish>Garlic knots with marinara sauce</dish> $3.00 1 large <dish>salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing</dish> $5.99 1 large <dish>Veggie Delight pizza</dish> with pepperoni on half $18.25+  2 <dish>Cannolis</dish> $3.25 each  Fortunately for us, it arrived in under 45 minutes. I was so hungry that I started working on my second garlic knot before my SO could finish paying the delivery guy, who was also pleasant and friendly. It came with 6 knots. They were warm and had ample garlic flavor. We had already taken one slice of pizza each when I realized I forgot to take a picture for Yelp. Oh well. I have never had a veggie pizza with eggplant before. Although I am not a fan of eggplant, I think it's a nice addition. It also had a generous amount of black olives, green peppers, mushrooms, and onions as well as a decent amount of pepperoni on half. The pepperoni half was my half. I was pleased with the low salt and grease levels. Flavor was good, but not mind blowing.   The salad was okay. It came with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, onions, mozzarella cheese, and croutons. I think I'll try their Greek salad next time. The cannolis were big and drizzled with chocolate syrup. The person who took our order asked if we wanted chocolate syrup on top. Who would actually say no to that? They probably Hershey's chocolate syrup if I were to guess. Again, not mind blowing but was sweet enough to satisfy our sweet tooth.  Glad this place delivers. Prices are reasonable especially for the portions. I look forward to trying more items on the menu and stopping by one day.",1
9YB4qqmyglww3bbW7i0kOA,"Had to try the new ramen spot. There's so many it's had for them to standout. This one was pretty good. Lots of variety on the menu. They also let you choose your spice level and give you the option of putting the spice on the side. I ordered mine hot all mixed in, I enjoyed it. The broth could have had a little more depth, it was miso base but didn't have much miso flavor. I was surprised it didn't come with an egg and I had to add a soft boiled for $1.50 I was also disappointed it was closer to hard boiled. I also ordered the goma sesame cucumber, these were tasty and the squid in wasabi I also enjoyed this, the wasabi wasn't too strong. Overall it was decent, the price was average, around $8.65 for a big bowl of <dish>ramen</dish>. Noodles were fresh, I got more noodles compared to the other people at my table, they got more vegetables than anything else."

The chicken is more flavorful and their veggies are crispier.  I always order the<dish> burrito in a bowl</dish> with chicken, black beans, their hottest salsa and extra cilantro.  Something else that adds to their awesomeness, there are no extra charges for sour cream or guac--which I think all their direct competitors do.

I threw in an extra star because the staff was kind and attentive.   Ordering is reminiscent of McDonald's where you tell them what you want and pay at the counter - then listen for your name and go pick up your food on a tray. I had <dish>combo pho with shrimp and rare steak</dish>. It wasn't bad but I also wouldn't return for it. I don't know if I can adequately describe the small difference between the taste of the pho here versus the taste at any pho place along Spring Mountain. The noodles, for one thing, are flat. I don't mind flat noodles but I'm hoping that detail can summarize the small noticeable differences between my go to soup spots and this.  If I was at the Rio and didn't want to drive to a different spot for my fix, I'd have Pho Da Nang again. The thai tea was strong but surprisingly good, so there is that.

9i1aaJp0bClI8Lf_dSd5kw,"i hate scorpions probably more than the average human being. so when we decided to move to arizona, i wanted to make sure i never had to face one of those suckers... er, at least in our home.   MONTHS before moving to arizona, i started doing research on pest control and after reading rave reviews for lights out, we decided to give them a try. the day we got the keys to our home, we had him come out to do a black light inspection so we could see what we were working with. luckily, we didn't have a scorpion problem but we did have a few crickets (scorpion food) and some black widows (no biggie, right?!). jason assured us that our situation was manageable and gave us a treatment plan which included landscape suggestions, some fun tips on different desert pests. he even gave us recommendations on how to prevent unwelcome friends from moving with us from our new york apartment!  another thing i like about jason is his honesty and straight forwardness.  if it were up to me, i would have had somebody spraying our house at least once a month.  but jason assured us that it wasn't necessary and while it was good for his business, it was not incrementally helpful for us.  that made me feel more at ease with his way of business- the client's interests come first and that is the backbone of great service.  more reasons that make jason the right guy for the job: - he's super knowledgable and eager to share info regarding different types of bugs, treatments available, and other environmental factors - he never tried to oversell us and always presented multiple options (and pros/cons of each option)  - he once called to reschedule due to wind conditions- he easily could've sprayed anyway but he was conscious of his treatment effectiveness and how his clients will benefit (wind would've reduced the effectiveness of the treatment) - he also took care of my sister in a scorpion emergency when she moved to a new scorpion-infested home."

9l0QcFehRrxDZLy5_so_kg,"In an age where teenagers are getting $10-$25 an hour to babysit children (yes, that's live HUMAN beings), I find it astonishing that an AZ pet sitting service would have the audacity to charge $32 for a 1/2 hour cat visit! If you do the math, that's $64/hour folks, and nearly double the rate I paid in California (which is far more costly in nearly every service area than AZ, especially for taxes, gas and groceries). In LA, for that rate, you could get an overnight stay from a cat sitter and $40 for a dog sitter. So for an AZ service to charge a high rate, I figured the service better be damn good! And with high Yelp ratings, I would expect nothing less than perfect customer service.  I contacted this pet sitting service after being called out of town for a last minute business trip. I had no time to prepare and they were available and amenable and had excellent reviews (not sure where those came from), so I thought \surely, they must be superb.\"" Um wrong...not so much.  On the one hand, they made themselves available in a pinch. On the other, they were so over focused on fees it is astonishing. I received an initial quote of $31/HR based on general location and as soon as they received my actual address, the first thing they did was increase the rate another dollar an hour. Wow. Really. Greedy. Not a great first impression. Again, I was in a pinch so I said yes.   This service did not ask me a single thing about my pets (in hindsight, big red flag). No questions on distinguishing characteristics, which pet is which, quirks, personality or food needs. Wow.  I had literally just moved into my home, was not even finished unpacking boxes yet and days before my unexpected business trip me and the cats had driven 19 hours straight through the night after rescuing one of my two cats from a horrific hoarding situation.   I wrote an extensive email about what the cats had gone through and that they were distressed as was I (especially to have to leave my babies behind so soon after such a traumatizing situation). I asked to be texted to give me updates, a no brainer! I received a precursory text day one of my trip and then nothing for the next 3 days. When asked what was going on, I got an \""oh, we didn't realize you wanted to be texted everyday.\"" Hello, if you are charging $64/hour for pet sitting service you better be anticipating your customers every need and providing high touch customer service. My sitters in Santa Monica and Ojai texted me regularly and went way above and beyond this service. They asked about collecting mail, watering yard/plants, made sure to get vet contacts, cat illness history, and reassured me daily all was well.  I came home to litter kicked out of the two cat pans on the floor of both bathrooms, the guest bathroom toilet filthy from an adult taking a #2. Um, there was a toilet bowl brush next to the toilet. Common courtesy would dictate you take care of that shit (pun intended) since it's not your home and you're being paid to be there.  Next, my home, which I wasn't even fully moved into yet, was partially rearranged. Like don't touch my stuff ok?! If I put a cat post in a window parallel to the window, I do not want to come home and find it moved to an angle because that's how the pet sitter would put it in her home or decorations moved around because you think they would look better that way, or my cat carriers moved to where the cats can't get into them with the doors closed. Cats are notorious for needing quiet dark, familiar places and both these cats were using the carriers to feel comfortable being in moving chaos and the carriers had been moved and the doors shut. WTF?  Next, in the food department at least one if not two full cans of wet cat food were overstuffed into bowls by the kitchen. Way to attract ants and bugs people. Cats eat at most 1/2 to a 1/4 of a can of cat food at a time. Leaving dry food out is fine, the wet food was a waste of expensive food to leave it that way.  On my way home, I texted the sitter (different from the business owner) with instructions on where to leave key and got a sarcastic \""yes ma'am.\"" Since you are supposed to be a professional and this is your first time working for me, you don't have the familiarity and intimacy to make a joke like that which fell flat. Do yourself a favor, don't make jokes until after you have established a personal relationship with your clients!  The owner, who mentioned I could pay her via PayPal, was far more concerned about the fact that when I paid her selecting \""vendor/service\"" criteria, that she would be charged a fee, than she was that I had returned safely, that the animals were ok and had received the care they needed. She texted 3x about this and never once asked whether the animals were ok, again indicating an over focus on money and what's best for the pet sitting service than the needs of the customer and their pets!"""

9mIm1ef-NVDQHFE39Faxxg,"I used to really enjoy this place and have had tons of fun here. Cheap drinks, enjoy some of the staff, good specials, trashy and divey. I enjoy all those things. After the last couple visits, but especially tonight, I'm sure I won't be back.  Me and one of my girlfriends wanted to go get a beer and a bite to eat after work tonight. I suggested Dos Gringos. She got there first and said they didn't appear to be open. Hm, weird. So I said <restaurant>the Vine</restaurant>. We used to frequent this place often, but now its once in a blue moon.  It was pretty dead inside, which we were ok with. We sat at the bar. We ordered our <dish>beers</dish> and asked for menus. She ordered the special of <dish>chicken fingers and fries</dish>, I got a 1/2 order of <dish>nachos</dish> with chicken added. The food came out pretty fast, which was nice. We were hungry. My friend seemed to enjoy her food. Mine, oh man... These have got to be the worst nachos I've ever seen in my entire life. It was basically chips with big pieces of chewy, dry, bland chicken on top with salsa and sour cream on the side. Very  little chips and salsa on the side. To find a chip with cheese or refried beans on it was very rare. How can you fuck up nachos??? I'm not sure, but they did. Badly.  So yeah, food totally sucked. I ate it. What sucks worse then having terrible food when this hungry? Shit service. In a dead bar. Yes, that happened as well.  Absolutely awful service tonight. I didn't even want to tip the guy, but I did. Yes, I ate my food (or a quarter of it), but I did feel it necessary to mention how much I didn't enjoy it, he didn't give 2 shits. He said with a smartass voice that he was sorry with his back turned and walking away from me. Ugh. I'm so angry at The Vine for allowing such low standards when it used to be a great place to go. $13 with tip for 1 beer and the worst nachos I've ever put in my mouth is way too much money!!!! I've decided at the end, right now, me returning won't happen for sure. I don't deal well with bad service like that!",1

9u-d_b2Gf6-h4LXcxRI3Og,"I would put a score of zero if I could. I was there a few days ago and wish I thought of leaving a review sooner. I went for an oil change and asked the service writer if the mechanic could put air in my tires since the light was on as well as a synthetic oil change. He said that was no problem. While waiting for my car, I overhead the mechanic throwing a fit saying that if \he got one more oil change, he was going to tell the customer to f*k off, close the doors, and flip the customer off\"". When my car was \""done\"", the service writer was not there and the mechanic informed me he was done and would have to ring me up. He asked me how much cash I had on me and when I said $20, he said \""That's not good\"". I then told him I had planed on using my debit card but if there is an ATM nearby, I could pull money out. He got frustrated and called the service writer to come back and ring me up since he doesn't know how to charge people using a bank card. Not only did I have to deal with that, my gauge still says that I need to change oil and no air was put in my tires. Afraid to go back there and have my car worked on. Won't be going back.

Which in my opinion, shouldn't be an issue for a professional cleaners. My clothes however? They ruined one of my favorite dresses. I didn't notice it right away because it was with a bunch of other stuff and it wasn't the right season for the dress, but they completely messed up the padding in the bust area. They don't even have an onsite seamstress that could fix it for me, and instead suggested another place.... Which I would have to pay for! Why should I have to pay to get something fixed that NEVER should have been messed up in the first place??? I have some friends who can rip the seams, flatten the padding, and sew it back up so no one would even know the \pros\"" messed it up. Also, they should have \""if items dropped off before 9:00 am\"" written below the part about \""same day service available.\"" I waited in line several minutes before just walking back out with my items because I was told they wouldn't be ready by the time I needed them.

My wife and I had close relatives move to Charlotte recently, so we flew in yesterday from Pennsylvania to help them unpack, etc. We were all starving so we ordered what was our first two pizzas from <restaurant>Anzi's</restaurant>.

Me: I told you we just flew in so I'm not driving all the way back. She: Well, what do you want ME to do?! Me: I just wanted you know. She: Are you sure it's sausage and not onions?! Me infuriated by now: I have your order slip right here and it says half pepperoni/half onions IN RED. No where on either pizza did we order sausage. And also I'm not 9 years old!

Walking into the restaurant, I could tell that a lot of thought was put into the interior design. Unlike other Korean restaurants which hold utensils in a container on the table, the tables here have drawers that can pull out revealing chopsticks and spoons. The prices are very reasonable - $8.95 for bibimbap of all different varieties. They have standard beef and egg, spicy octopus, pork and sprouts, chicken, and fish egg. I had the <dish>fish egg bibimbap</dish> which was delicious! Their side dishes had the standard kimchi and picked vegetables, along with two types of salad, tofu and pasta.

The Scottsdale store is... lifeless. You walk in, and there's almost never someone in the front to greet you. Employees here seem disengaged and apathetic. Unless you're buying shoes, you'll have tremendous difficulty finding someone to provide assistance--even though the ratio of employees to customers is usually 2:1. Checkout usually requires 10-15 minutes of tapping your credit card on countertop at the register before someone walks over to address you. After my last experience, where I waited over 15 minutes, made eye contact with three employees, and still no help, I walked out without my purchases.

I love how chipotle burritos aren't warmed with everything melted together, that's burrito boyz' specialty.  It's nice that it's slightly warm with all the cool, refreshing toppings inside. The meat is very tasty (I only get chicken). Although, I find the mild salsa very spicy, should be relabelled as medium-hot.. Or maybe I just can't handle the heat!

AC8AK8ek3K06pgjsNrsFRA,"There are, at present, two Sidewalk Citizen locations in Calgary. This one is on 10th Street. It's a little bakery and deli rolled into one, and it is open Monday through Sunday (source: their web site; hopefully Yelp will update with that information soon).  They are directly connected to a small natural foods market (which has some gelato from Fiasco Gelato and some gluten-free macarons in their refrigerated aisle). It's basically one counter (ish) for baked goods and one for the deli. There's a stand upon which their bread is placed, and racks of pastries being prepped/cooled near the ovens.  Some of their offerings seem to change on a daily basis. One day, it might be blueberry Danishes and the next day, it'll be raspberry ones. Their bread selection is also on a schedule. Sourdough is pretty common, but on some days, you might see brioche or ciabatta. The bread is already laid out in paper bags and I didn't see an option of getting it sliced.  The staff member and cashier were efficient and pleasant. In fact, I ended up receiving a free Danish. :)  As for the pastries themselves, I found them to be less flaky and slightly more expensive than the ones from Manuel Latruwe Belgian Patisserie & Bread Shop. I like that they put fresh fruit on their Danishes; however, there wasn't that much fruit compote on the ones I got. Overall, it's a good quality bakery for the residents nearby, but I don't think it's the absolute best in Calgary."

Parking is super easy as well as loading and unloading of equipment. As a dj, that is always a concern. Lol. The flooring is all tile, so that is not always the best for the acoustics of a room, so it does echo a little bit."
AED5R0yXVzJvWAGEqWBG4A,"I'd like to start with the ambiance, it is absolutely gorgeous with white marble tables and a lot of natural light coming through their wide window. I've just learned about <dish>Neo coffee bar</dish> via Instagram and i've already visited 6 times in the month of February. I have tried their <dish>Matcha latte</dish> with both Almond milk and Cashew milk, as well as their traditional <dish>green tea bag</dish>, and <dish>drip coffee</dish>. With respect to goodies, i've tasted their <dish>matcha roll cake</dish>, <dish>matcha white academia cookie</dish> as well as v<dish>egan sugar free breakfast cookie</dish> - which was my absolute favourite, super nourishing, filling, chewy and satisfying. The service all 6 times has been phenomenal, as they have a smile on, greet you nicely, accomodate customers, and provide helpful answers with any questions. In addition to that, i had requested for a special latte art on my drink and the barista was kind enough to try his best to make what i requested. I would definitely recommend this place for a pick me up and lovely photos for food photographers. My only concern was seating, but if you go early enough or wait around you will definitely snatch a seat. There is a variety of couch corner tables, individual seating which can be tight but fine for one person, as well as a high top bench/bar.",1

AIEyiX9-yfXQgvLOtBgFgA,"Went here for the first time. I was a bit apprehensive considering some of the reviews but I had great luck and my opinion on the <occasion>lunch</occasion> prices are quite fair. $10 for a Chimichanga+Sides+Drink is VERY reasonable compared to Madison area prices.   <dish>Chimichanga</dish> (Avocado+Veggies) - 4.5/5 - I'd say the best part of the meal. I highly recommend the diablo or other hot sauces available to give your meal a bold kick but I prefer spicy food when it comes to Mexican. There was some hard pieces in the chimichanga (one of the vegetables used - not sure which) that seemed out of place. This is comparable to El Pastor's(Park Street) Avocado Chimichanga which is a great option for Stoughton.  Rice 2/5 - Probably one of the lesser favorites of the meal. The flavor seemed like a boxed spanish rice which is not really great. I prefer the one at El Rio Grande.  Beans 3/5 - A decent side but again, not the best I've had. Somewhere in the middle.  Service 5/5 - Friendly and quick service. Although I didn't get chips with the meal(I know there was complaints about that), the food came so fast I doubt I would have gotten any chips in. To be fair, I was the only one there not doing the buffet but I've been to enough places to know that isn't always a guarantee for speed.   Prices 5/5 - Again, to me, these seem very fair for Madison area prices.   Hopefully the place grows as Stoughton always needs more restaurant variety and because it is more of an authentic mexican style(el pastor/taqueria guadalajara/los gemelos/etc.) - it is a great alternative to El Rio Grande's more mainstream style(Senor Peppers,  Lalo's Mexican Restaurant). Both existing in Stoughton is a great thing as both styles and flavors are great for certain crowds and days of the week.",1

AKPLL7N4yTidQF7xY8kneg,"I've seen two movies here, and wouldn't have returned today if the movie weren't free... (We were seeing an advance screening of Super-8 today!) Though I doubt I'd return even for a free film after today's experience. Without going into a detailed story:  -The seats are mildly uncomfortable but distractingly noisy - they squeak whenever anyone adjusts position in their seats, so all film long. -The popcorn is priced as though it were premium, but even the \actually premium\"" flavored popcorns, at $7 for a medium, are not fresh, which was a major disappointment for the price. Their standard popcorn was mediocre.  WORST: They have all-digital projection, which I usually prefer, but the projector in the theater I was in today (#2) was out of alignment somehow. The distance between the red and blue light, on the right half of the image, was enough that it felt like I was watching one of the old red-blue 3D films; the colors were all off and there were colored halos around anything high-contrast. If I had paid for tickets, I would have walked out in the first minute.  Annoying seats, mediocre concessions, and to top it off bad projection? I guess if you were drinking at their bar, you might not notice? Ugh."""
ALgH4S65heUffUjcBiNJ0Q,"Pet friendly patio! We've come here for Mutt 'N' Mingle for the past two months and I always appreciate when restaurants allow well-behaved dogs outside.   As for their happy hour food, the prices aren't stellar. I mean, I enjoyed their <dish>onion rings</dish> well enough, but I felt like $6 is pretty much normal price at most bars. But a $3 draft <dish>Guinness</dish>? That's nothing to sniff at!   They have TVs EVERYWHERE- behind the bar, along the walls, inside each of the booths... If there's a game on, you can watch it. They have a nice looking pool table and a small shuffleboard table (\Not regulation size!\"" my friend would chastize) and a burger I can't wait to try (The Terminator - bacon, avocado and havarti.

ALwAlxItASeEs2vYAeLXHA,"One of my friends had a hair in her <dish>ramen</dish>. A short black hair about 2 inches long (way darker than our hair so it certainly wasn't from us). She wasn't hungry anymore but I kept eating. Nearly to the bottom of my bowl and I found the same kind of black hair. I asked for a manager and he said \that things like this happen\"" . As someone who has worked in the service industry for 10 years, I couldn't believe those words were said. Yes, these things happen but twice?! Are they even wearing hair nets in the kitchen? Then he said he was sorry, and offered an ice cream. I turned down the ice cream.  I'm not squeamish but I left there very uncomfortable. I was even more uncomfortable that nothing was done for us other than offering ice cream. Is it unreasonable to think that after finding hair in two dishes, we'd get at least one dish taken care of... Particularly, the bowl that had three bites taken? I won't be back.""",1

ANfmkeFbBgNRc4AN1bpFaw,"Our first time and it was super fun! The instructor was wonderful and funny, the wait staff was accommodating and the food was actually pretty decent.

Oh and it was my birthday so I was brought to the front of the class and received a bday pastry with a candle and the class sang Happy Birthday . I definitely recommend taking a class! ! Amanda"
ANmMChurdD2V1KpkMf60Rw,"I joined Gold's recently so that I could get more spin in my life :) I've been taking one class a week elsewhere and wanted a cheap way to get more classes in. They have an extensive class schedule, with enough days and times to fit into anyone's schedule. The staff is really friendly and welcoming.   So far, I've only used the spin room. It's on the smaller side, with maybe 30 bikes. The bikes leave a lot to be desired. Some of them are a bit rickety; two of them actually broke during the last class I went to. The teachers are great though! John and Erin S. are the two instructors that I've seen and they're each motivating in their own way.   Since they don't post prices anywhere, here's an overview: $10/month gets you a basic, month-to-month membership that doesn't include classes and you can't go to any other locations. $15/month gets you a 1 year contract membership that includes classes and other locations. $19/month is the no-contract version of the previous membership. There is also a $40 maintenance fee, charged once a year.   For what I need, Gold's is an excellent value and I'm enjoying my membership so far. They do have a ladies only equipment area, which is great, since the meatballs monopolizing the other equipment can be kinda scary."

Only downfall is they aren't always open when I want to go there, but it's totally understandable.",1

AUhevEi21Aqu-ISgaTcv6g,"I found out about Studio Vino while having a conversation about 30th bday presents for friends with a coworker. Here's how it went.  Coworker: My sister's 30 birthday is coming up and we don't know what to get her. Any ideas?  Me: As a matter of fact, I have a friend with a 30th bday soon and here's what I planned. It's sort of a \welcome to your 30s\"" tool kit, complete with khaki Capri pants, a belt clip for your cell phone, a pair of crocs and maybe a gift cert for a sensible hair cut that says \""I don't need keep up with fashion because I'm 30 now and above all that.\""  Coworker: Um...yeah.  To dissuade me from my hilarious present, she then sent me a link to Studio Vino, where you can custom label any of the bottles of wine for special occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, babies, weddings - whatever. So, you send them a picture of your parents, your sister, etc., come up with a name for your wine and maybe a tagline (I imagine \""Just Keeps Getting Better With Age\"" is pretty popular). Then the owner designs a label using colors you request or she'll do it all on her own. All (including the wine) for like $15! Wow, what a unique gift with a quick turnaround (in my case 24 hours) for less than $20  I made one for my mom for her bday. Since her dog is pretty special to her, I put his picture on the bottle, called the wine \""Hair of the Dog\"" and made it \""Draco's Special Reserve.\"" Kari, the owner and the one who designs your labels, came up with a color scheme that complemented the image, and even made the \""o\"" in \""Draco\"" a paw print. Cu-u-u-te. Mom LOVED it and the gift was the hit of the party. Here's how it went down: I sent Kari my desired image and text via email Saturday at about 2p. She sent me three versions within an hour. I picked one and asked her to tweak the colors, she sent me the new version. I OK'd it and had the bottle in hand by 1p the next day.  That being said, custom labeling is not the crux of this business, but is merely a convenient off-shoot of her very cool enterprise. At Studio Vino, you pay about $350 to make and bottle your very own case of wine. So, you choose a grape, spices, flowers, roots - whatever, mix it up, she barrels it at her studio for 75 days (or the allotted time). Then you come back in with up to six of your friends and have a bottling and label-making party - complete with food and music of your choice. You can do a half case for a little less, I believe.   Pretty great, huh? Now go - be a bday hero and give the best present of all time!  p.s. i'm still giving the hilarious welcome to your 30s tool kit present - it will just now also include the \""real\"" present of a kick ass bottle of wine!"""

Tonight completely left a sour taste in my mouth that wasn't from my mediocre <dish>burrito</dish>. When my friend and I (who also works with me) arrived, the staff looked extremely unhappy and exhausted. My friend tried to make small talk with the girl who warms the tortillas and she was so exhausted and mentioned it had been busier than normal when my friend asked which is understandable. the girl who was working the line seemed upset as well. it was then I noticed the cashier, Jalon (whose name was on the receipt, which is really convenient when the employees don't wear name tags) was berating the girl working the line for a mistake she had made and for not being further on the pre closing checklist. my friend said to cut her some slack and I interjected that as a manager in my job, I've never treated my employees with such disrespect. she immediately responded that that was her friend and continued to berate the girl. Jalon rang me up incorrectly and when I corrected the order she yelled at the girl working the line and said loudly to me \and see you were trying to defend her!\"". it was such an uncomfortable situation and I noticed she continued to be rude and abrasive.  this is pretty unacceptable for a place of business and I will be contacting this store directly to inform them of how their employees are being treated.   no wonder everyone working looked like they'd rather get hit by a bus than be working the line with such a rude person.""",1

This was the first time I've ever had a Novocaine shot and not felt the shot.  Nothing. Not an ounce of pain.  Dr. Racanelli and his team are so informative, gentle, and friendly.    It's a great added touch when the Dr. calls you in the evening after getting major work done just to make sure your are doing ok.   Actually, there are ton of added touches that make this place awesome...the tour of the whole office on your first visit, the chapstick they give you to keep your lips from getting too dry while you are getting work done, the warm towel to clean up after you are done, the blankets they offer you if you get cold, the fact that they are so prompt with this appointments and I'm always seated within mere minutes of arriving....I could go on and on.

I was interested in signing up my son for skate lessons but was concerned he was to young and little. They did a free private class with my son in order to evaluate him, and I thought that was awesome. We had Tyler for our instructor and he did really well with my little guy. Tyler is very professional and knowledgeable and friendly. The skate area is smaller than others I've been to, but I think it's a great spot for beginners.

Whenever the workers are not helping someone at the desk, they're wandering around picking up toys and wiping things down.

AtZOA9ZvERdTjYwQhMrHhA,Ok so I have a update from my last visit. I told them they need to change the crush washer when they drain the oil because subarus are known to leak oil when you don't replace it every time. Apparently they didn't so I took it in and told them hey my car is leaking oil and they told me to come straight in. Went in the front of the line and they confirmed that they in fact did not replace the crush washer so they replaced it apologized for it and didn't charge me anything. I would give them a higher star rating but because I now have a oil stain on my garage floor. I figured a 3 star rating would suffice. Jared service manager was really good about taking car of it so thank you if your reading this.

He had a very nasty case of kennel cough, KEEP AWAY from doggie daycares, and the vet was able to diagnose him, and start treatment ASAP. The vet was so down to earth, he suggested certain things and treatments to test for the disease, which typically any other given vet would have MADE you do, but more importantly went over realistic options of how to get my little man well again, without breaking my bank. I was given his medication on the spot, the overall visit was maybe only an hour at the most, no wait time at all, and I walked out of there with a $120 vet bill, the lowest vet bill I've ever seen!

They gave him a list of the real Urgent care places and sent him away. The one he drove to on the list, Boulder Quick Care, appeares to be permanently closed. Son is now driving, sick as a dog, to another place. Don't waste your time here or on their website.  Hours and services are misrepresnted."
Awz0pdZbfSHnprg3cyq2aw,"I will unfortunately not be coming back to this dry cleaners.  First, the positives.  The service was completed promptly, priced fairly, packaged carefully, and the email confirmation that your garments are ready for pickup is a nice touch.  Now the bad.  Customer service at the counter left much to be desired.  First, let's talk about greetings.  It is expected in any place of business for staff to greet customers politely.  I did not get a \hi, I'll be right there,\"" but rather a brusque \""picking up?\"" from one of the ladies staffing the counter. She barely made eye contact and continued to do her other duties (wrapping other garments) and made me awkwardly wait by the doorway while she finished so that she can look me up on their system.  I understand the need to multi-task, but a polite comment of, \""I'm so sorry, let me just finish this and I'll be right there,\"" goes a long way in making the customer feel acknowledged and welcome rather than interrupting.  I'll spare the details, but the lady at the counter was also very insistent on something about my garment that I was simply asking a clarification for, but instead of a polite answer, I received snappy comments that definitely did not make me feel appreciated as a customer.  After I paid, I did not even warrant a \""thank you, have a great day!\"" but instead received an awkward stare while I gathered my garments.  I hope that management takes these comments as constructive feedback rather than criticisms.  These are behaviors than can easily be remedied with additional staff training.  Unfortunately, I greatly value customer service over price or convenience so I will be looking for another dry cleaner that aligns with this need."""

AyOKFrLeuFCp9CzGDB_qYw,"What can I say about a place called <restaurant>Bok Bok</restaurant>?  it was OK OK!  This is a Mediterranean style restaurant focusing on three types of main meats.  Beef, Chicken and Falafel.   <dish>Beef Shawerma Plate</dish> - I did not see the large turning cone or rotisserie of beef so I cannot tell you if it was shaved from a rotisserie or where the meat came from.  Served with a salad rice, pickles, pita bread we also had a choice of hummus or mutabbal.  Overall, the portion of beef was a bit anemic but okay in taste.  <dish>Chicken Shawerma Plate</dish> - Just like the beef, served with rice, salad, pickles, pita bread and choices, but with almost a quarter to half a rotisserie chicken.  Here you can see the chickens on the rotisserie and you get quite a bit of chicken for the price. Tasty, juicy, I can tell you that this plate stood out and was very good.  We were sharing with a friend so we had a side of the <dish>Fattoush Salad</dish>, a basic salad with watercress, green onion, tomato, cucumber, bell pepper and pita chips.  Good, tasty, no mint leaves which is good for me!  We had the <dish>Cheese Boreg</dish> which is fried dough with cheese. Pretty good, never had it.  The <dish>TOOM</dish>, the garlic with lemon and olive oil is great.  Other side we had was the <dish>Sarma</dish>, or stuffed grape leaves.    For dessert, we had all three. The <dish>Baklava</dish>, the <dish>Ashta</dish> (really nice) and the <dish>Gatnaboor</dish> which was a rice pudding.  I think we should have had three orders of the Ashta.   Everything here was pretty good, only the rotisserie for the meat was missing and I generally like to see lamb options at a middle eastern restaurant.  For this, I can only give it a three star due to no LAMB! This restaurant is like what Chipotle is to Mexican food, and so, you will see mostly gringos here eating and not the middle eastern people themselves.  Good, clean place with decent prices. May come back but I really like a few other places for my middle eastern fixings.",1
AyUO53ftWgCU0gcrYMb3cQ,Good flavours in the <dish>ice cream</dish> and <dish>cookies</dish> and but the ice cream sandwich at $5.95 were a little high.  The cupcakes seemed underpriced at 3.95 just because of how ornate they are.  Everything was delicious,1

Luckily Theresa, who does my lash extensions and is amazing, is now working at salon jo-el. The salon is very impressive, modern vibe, and very clean! Lash extensions take awhile but the room is very comfortable and relaxing. I can't forget to mention my lashes look amazing and very natural, I always get compliments after Theresa does my lashes.

B6Lja_ShYdicusIlEvaotQ,"I work at a business in Old Town Scottsdale and was just made aware of all the wineries downtown. I stopped by this place on a Saturday afternoon with a couple of people and not many people were there (which was perfect, as it filled up as we were leaving!). It's a big space with a long bar, and space in the back for a private group.  We picked some <dish>wines</dish> for our tasting (I can't remember all of them - maybe it was all the wine I was drinking that day...), but I do remember them to all be delicious. We tried the current vintage with last year's wine and it was cool because you could actually taste the difference.   We also had a <dish>chocolate pairing</dish> (from Zak's Chocolate) with our wines. One of the chocolates was a <dish>prickly pear chocolate</dish> and I think it was paired with a white wine, and oh my gosh... it was the best pairing I've ever had. The flavors completely complemented each other. (And they introduced us to Zak's Chocolate!).  I loved the atmosphere in the room - with the barrels behind the bar, the clean feel, and the kind and talkative wine pourer!   We left buying the <dish>2013 Rule of Three</dish>, a Syrah blend, and a <dish>2014 Sweet Adeline</dish>, a Riesling.",1
B7UeQVtXDcH8EXTc8p_M1Q,"We have been customers of this restaurant for a few years. We absolutely love their pizza. However, we will NEVER return to this restaurant again.  We met friends (also frequent diners) for am impromptu Thursday night <occasion>dinner</occasion>.  Thursdays at Beach Club are retail wine Thursdays. As we were choosing our <dish>wine</dish> ($10 off bottles of wine) we noticed that the menu included a line that said that $20 gift cards would be issued on any bottle purchased over $40. We immediately did the math and decided on a wonderful $45 bottle of wine. The gift card could only be used on a later visit ( no problem as we were regulars). When our bill came we noticed the $10 hadn't been removed and we asked he waitress about the gift card. Even though she heard our thinking process as we ordered the wine, she told us...now..that we couldn't have both promotions. This was not specified ANYWHERE in the menu. When I spoke with the manager, Nicole, she conceded that the menu would need to be changed to reflect this exclusion but was completely unwilling to honor the mistake, even if it meant losing a repeat customer. I even called the owner of this restaurant and Beach Club Bistro in Euclid and he was even less amiable.  He asked why we would deny him the chance to make a living. Really, for a bottle of wine mark-up 100%? For $20, to lose a customer? Terrible customer service! We were not trying to get something for nothing, just trying to get them to honor what is in print.  My guess is it will change tomorrow.",1
B7lWxgPmJPJJ7Mz2OL6aAg,Took a Postmates for this place. Drove over 10 minutes to show up and see the doors were locked and all lights off before business hours were over. No sign or anything. Super unprofessional and bad business. Wasting multiple people's times

The other one shrugs, comes over, takes the soy and dumps what's left of the container in the cup of ice. It was quite literally a splash. Hands it back to the first guy and goes back to the drive-thru window. First guy adds the caramel and then fills the rest with coffee and hands it to me. I figured I'd give it a try first and woah- very bitter. I ask the drive-thru guy for more soy and he doesn't say a word, just goes to the back to get a new carton, pours more soy in, and then goes back to the window. Not as bad as the Chandler/I-10 location but not nearly as good as Alma School/Germann. Would be nice if training and customer service were more consistent.",1

BDXod8xpyhjzePWDgdVhtA,Got a low heart rate? Blood pressure a little too low? Forget the medication and head to Costco on a Saturday! If your an avid Costco shopper you expect it and manage it the best you can. This place is always crazy busy but on this Saturday we hit the right check-out line and was through in about 10 minutes. Unfortunately with this Costco the price for gas is not very competitive. There is often lower priced fuel nearby - thanks to GasBuddy!  Although the crowds are big so are the discounts and the selection. Well worth the trip and the employees are also very efficient and helpful.
BEpUZHL0FdBWa4egx1r2LQ,"YUM!!!  I absolutely LOVE <restaurant>Pink berry</restaurant>...it's one of the newest favorite items on my \must have\"" list!   This location is right on the corner across from the movies, it's small and very clean, there are always a lot of employees working behind the counter, the samples are endless and the toppings are so delicious!   I love that they offer not only sprinkles, nuts and chocolate but also fresh fruit and those amazing waffle cookies....  A new found delight is the pomegranate sauce, they keep it hidden away, so make sure to ask for it after you finish loading up your yogurt with delicious toppings.   This visit I had the coconut and mango....two of my absolute favorite flavors, they were refreshing and so full of flavor and it was not watered down at all it tasted wonderful!   What made this visit even better....as if it could get any better!!! Is that my small with topping was FREE because I signed up for the mobile app! So if you haven't done so make sure to sign up and take advantage of that free treat.   And yes....it is pricey....I agree with all the previous reviews but in my opinion as a treat from time to time it is totally worth it!""",1

BNNTJgSICYQE_LRrn-Vc-w,"I have never met such an incompetent family practice. Avoid this place at all costs.  Let me first say that I am not disputing the medical knowledge of Dr. Sparks in any way. She seems to know what she is talking about and is well learned. But these are the only things good about this place.  My family met with Dr. Sparks once. We had to wait over 2 months for an appointment. After waiting that long, one would think they would get some individual attention. That's a negative. Dr. Sparks did not take any interested in either my wife or I personally.  Even in the follow up visit, she did not respond to any of the personal bits of information and chit chat I had during our medical conversations. She stuck strictly to the facts and didn't care about my personal medical history.  Recently, multiple people in my family have had serious illness that required attention by the Dr. We called our family practice dr, Dr. Sparks. She was unable to take time for us on any occasion. Instead, we had to meet with a new doctor hired by Dr. Sparks. Both times, we had to wait over 45 minutes to see the doctor.   This is completely unacceptable. We made freaking appointments. Showed up at least 10 minutes early. Then had to wait 45 minutes until we were able to see a doctor. There is no universe that this is acceptable.  This practice has so many operational issues, not to mention priority problems. We are finding a new practice and would advise anyone else considering Dr. Sparks to stay far away unless they want terrible customer service."

BekE5N8XxnT3kcYA9tDqVA,"The idea of sharing the ice with a hundred people who are 1/3 my height and 1/10th my age, yet ten times better than me on the ice is a little terrifying, so I avoided the Nathan Phillips Square rink for my first few skating excursions of 2009. Natrel is considerably less busy during the week and there aren't as many school groups.  I did notice that the quality of the ice is kinda shitty for such a popular rink, but at least they renew it often. You can rent skates here and lock up your personal belongings indoors. There are no boards to grab onto in times of imbalance other than your boyfriend (or other nearest person)'s arm, so if you're a beginner maybe wear a helmet.  The music is excellent for skating (Backstreet Boys, TLC, Bel Biv Devoe), there is supervision, and not too many people skating ten abreast and generally fucking with your chi. They have DJ nights on Fridays & Saturdays, when the rink is open till 11pm, but so far I have only come here during the week, during the day.

Bh5VbI_9msk3GaD0kiKkmg,I have some friends that are vegan and they were really excited to try this place! I don't have any allergy or dietary concerns and was legitimately curious about what vegan soft serve was all about.  The storefront is nestled in the backside of the huge condo complex. It can be easy to miss but you can either walk through the main level commercial area or around the outside to their separate sidewalk-facing entrance.  Now Nanashake is a covert way of saying (ba)nanashake. The premise of the soft serve is frozen ripe bananas that is pressed through a machine to create the soft serve texture and signature look. They have a lot of different ways you can top off your <dish>nanashake</dish> and I was sold on the peanut butter mix-in and drizzle. The guy behind the counter was practically giving us a lesson in all that nanashake has to offer.   It tasted like a smooth and cold banana bread. SOLD!  Other flavours I would love to try include minty chocolate and spiced date.  I was definitely surprized by how much the mouthfeel texture resembled soft serve but just a tad thicker. I think this is a winner is my eyes and a healthier option to for those that crave something sweet-ish.  We took our nanashakes to the nearby park and just sat under a treat to marvel at the newest treat for vegans and non-vegas alike! I think two of us went back for some more nanashake takeaway.  Nanashake has genuinely surprized me with their offerings and I only wish I had one closer to me.,1
BhueLLvA0k9G1Lr0WeZX9w,"First off, don't be scared if there is a long line of people trying to order. It actually goes by pretty fast. What takes so long is the customers not being ready with their order. Once the order is in, it takes no time at all to prepare. Their SPECIAL isn't bad either, order a sandwich and a half soup or half salad for $8 and change. To be honest, the sandwiches are kind of on the small side but what they lack in size they make up for it in FLAVOR. I usually order the <dish>ultimate grilled cheese</dish> so I can dunk in my <dish>tomato soup</dish>, which is freaking AWESOME. Also, the <dish>cherry balsamic chicken salad</dish> is BOMB DOT COM! Both are a must try. They also have a nice assortment of fruit infused waters, which are delish, if your tired of the regular old fountain soda drinks. The orange infused berry one is my favorite. They also have yummy looking desserts(which I haven't tried yet, because I'm usually full) which consist of cheesecakes and brownies.

It was beyond the most \rudest\"" customer service I have ever seen in my life.  Bought a Spanish lavender the first day from them.  All was well.

We brought it back the next morning explaining the predicament and the sales lady who had been helping us said, no refunds.  Ok, well, we will exchange it for something else.   She was so rude, she took a perfectly fine plant and threw it on the ground like it was garbage.   I was so shock, we told her, let me speak with the manager.   She said to us, \""the manager would have done the same thing.\""  I was still like, give me their phone number and she wrote an email on their business card and literally threw the card back at us.  The furniture sales lady, who shares a booth with them witness all of this and apologized to us.  That lady should have apologized, not have someone apologize for them.

Bm6GI7Fr1lyAPPbBSRj-4A,"I had a TERRIBLE prior experience with a Brazilian wax 2 years ago and was not able to bring myself to get another one. It was an hour of agony and I was terrified that I would have to relive it. Well, one of my best friends gets waxed regularly here and she finally convinced me to give it a try again. I went to see her esthetician, Rebecca, who had already been told all about me. She was amazing. She was thorough, but it was all over in about 20 minutes. There were parts that were bad, but overall it was totally bearable. There is a definite skill and finesse to waxing vaginas, and Rebecca is a master!   The salon itself is clean, simplistic, and beautiful. I was greeted immediately and didn't have to wait at all. It was truly a wonderful experience. I highly recommend both LunchBox Wax and Rebecca. They will not disappoint!"
BmBmvI7Icrlo76RVwkiKUQ,First time to this <restaurant>First Watch</restaurant> since they bought out the Good Egg. It was great. Food was delicious. Really liked their menu selections. Have to say that I found it a big improvement over the Good Egg.,1
BmQ2k95KxmXd4OgcecEJaQ,Haven't been in much but it's a well stocked shop. Prices look good. First trip I was just looking around but the staff was friendly and answered my questions. The second trip I had a gun shipped to them. $20 for the ffl. Fast and easy. I will be back.

The first time I got a <dish>2 eggs with sausage combo</dish>, and the 2nd time I got the <dish>eggs benny</dish>.  The food here tastes healthy and fresh.  The hollandaise sauce on the benny had a nice lemony taste to it and it's a welcome change considering some place's poached eggs taste like vinegar.  Portions are big, imho, and both times I had items on the plate that I couldn't finish.  Prices could be a couple of dollars lower (It's $14 for a two-egg, peameal bacon benny and homefries) but considering that it's in a more low traffic area, it seems reasonable for a neighbourhood that's slowly but surely gentrifying.  Wait staff is super friendly! No complaints there.  Would def. return whenever I feel like heading into the Junction.",1
Bmv3nHS2nfjzhkDQMsLAWQ,"While I live just a few miles from here we just never come this way, so even though this is Z's fifth summer it was my first visit. And I have just one thing to say about taking so long: I'm an idiot.  I mean, it's not like the reviews have been so-so. 12 reviews and ALL five stars!? Hey, Sherlock, might that be a clue this is a \must-visit?\"" Well, shame on me for taking so long because this is a really neat place. It's very thoughtfully laid out, cute as heck inside, plenty of parking, great patio seating front and back, and the people--as so many reviews have said--just couldn't have been nicer. So, all that before we even talk about their ice cream.   I'm a Mitchell's fan. Haven't tried Churned but Mitchell's does a great job. What I had tonight at <restaurant>Z's</restaurant> was every bit as good and possibly better (in the interest of science I will need several more test visits) than Mitchell's. As a matter of fact, after one scoop I am ready to declare their chocolate mint chip THE best I've had anywhere including NYC, San Francisco, and anywhere in between. The \""salted caramel\"" (think I got that right) is better than Mitchell's version.  Just amazing home-made flavor. And,folks, go hungry, because those two scoops kept me busy for a while. A long while. Good thing I didn't eat dinner.   So, I'll wrap this up by saying don't make the same mistake I did by waiting to stop at Z's and appreciate the quality (QUALITY) products, great decor and layout, and super-duper nice people. This place deserves all the praise they get and I can't wait to go back.   Great job, Z's.""",1
Bmv9XzWZq7q7KpUjzhVvgw,"I stay at Hampton Inn's all the time when I travel. While they are nothing fancy, they are typically clean, consistent and safe. This was the exception. This is the first time I have stayed in a Hampton Inn where I truly felt unsafe.  My second night staying there I was awoken by a man entering my hotel room. I immediately got up and asked him what he was doing. Apparently he had just checked into the hotel and the front desk assigned him my already occupied room. The man was extremely apologetic and embarrassed but clearly it was not his fault. I called the front desk, the girl was clueless and offered no explanation and a rather unheartfelt apology. Fast forward to an hour later, same thing happens!!! This time I have the chain across the door and wake to a woman trying to get in. Again, I call the front desk, it's been shift change so I speak no a new guy. He has no clue about the first incident and seems to know nothing about why someone is trying to get in my room for the second time in an evening. His only explanation is \maybe it's an intoxicated person.\"" Not so much.   The next day I ask to speak to the manger who of course isn't there. I call her and she doesn't return my call. So after my training I show up and ask to speak to her. Initially she didn't seem too concerned but she ended up changing her tune. She compensated me with some Hilton Honors points but sadly those points didn't even get me a free night on an upcoming stay in another city. I was greatly disappointed that this happened not once but twice and I don't really feel that it was taken very seriously by the staff. Sadly, I had to stay here two more sleepless nights.   That being said, two stars for the fact my room was clean, updated and centrally located. Free breakfast and coffee as well."""

BpJlQ1yJKSL_hMSlm1dKHQ,"This is a case of knocking it before I try it, but my review is still based on facts. YumTum/ Toronto Underground Market is a food fair. You have to pay a cover and then you have access to various \vendors/chefs\"" selling food for reasonable prices. So where is the problem? The problem is that it's not a reasonable cost.   Online the cost is now $22.60/person PLUS a $2.50 service charge (WTF??!?). So basically you're looking at about $50 for two people...since you're probably not going alone.  Once in, each serving (depending on what it is, costs around $4-$5 on average). You're probably going to want to eat more than two things, since you're there, but lets say you're being cheap and you eat $10 worth of food. Now, for two people, you have spent $70....on a sampling of food, which may be good, but better be dipped in gold for that cost!  Other accounts tell me that this place is sort of turning into another Taste of the Danforth...which used to be awesome...and now it SO crowded, it's totally not enjoyable. So be prepared to wait in lines.   This event sounds like it has turned into a total racket. Someone is racking in the dough. I would LOVE to support local food vendors and chefs, but it won't be like this. If it was $20 and you got tickets towards vendors of your choice (got to choose 4 samples, for example), or was cheaper, it would make more sense to me. This doesn't feel like it's supporting chefs anymore though. Feels like a money-grab.  Let's see what else...parking is hard to come by...according to Yum Tum's website and so they provide a shuttle bus that runs EVERY THIRTY MINUTES!   For $70+ I can go and get a nice, sit down dinner with my husband...parking outside the door and that's what I'll be doing this Saturday. Have fun paying $70 for a few nibbles everyone!"""

We were asked about the tour, it seems everyone that comes in is offered a tour, I don't know if there are really tour times, or just people are here, wanna pay to meet Wade? We did not go on the tour. We walked around and looked over the fence, there was NOTHING going on, nobody around in the work area.   In the shop there were a lot of tanks for sale and fish, I don't know much about fish, but they say there is a 24 hour guarantee, with all kinds of requirements, I think if I am paying thousands for a tank and hundreds on fish, they would last more than 24 hours, especially with a service maintaining it.   While we were walking up my wife tripped and almost took out the General. That was a highlight, but we couldn't get a picture with him or even of him as he bolted inside the office.   We ended up spending a few hundred on shirts for everyone, and they threw in some autographed pictures."

I have to admit, there have been some mechanical issues that are frustrating, but I've been through this before (moving into a brand new building), so I know these issues aren't too common... I would be more impressed with faster responses from the maintenance- but that's that.  Its crazy that every single place here is different. I LOVE my place, it was made for me- bachelorette pad :) and I feel good knowing no one else has a condo like it. The finishing really make my place awesome- and the windows are exquisite, but we will see if they result in a higher electric bill in the summer months.  The onsite benefits are great- my dog LOVES the park out back, and I can't wait to use the new movie theater and pool. The vibe is young and lively, but more professional then neighboring communities. I moved from Ogden when it got a little too party happy for me. The security is great- which is important for me being downtown.  For me though, its more of the area versus the Juhl. I can't wait to see what goes in their retail shops.

CAzLsMtoCZAuBeLnnOqmxw,"I was slightly leery about renting a car after reading some of the reviews.  But then again, most people really only write bad reviews for rental car companies.  I booked through Priceline and got an awesome deal for a compact car; the amount I paid for 6 days was equivalent to the amount previously paid for a 3 day airport car rental.  Enterprise had no problems with my reservation and they had a driver pick me up from my apartment (providing an hour window) and straight to the rental car location.    The actual location is very clean so they apparently really stepped up their game.  Its definitely not as chaotic as a airport rental company and the car they selected was clean and pretty impressive for a Hyundai.  The attendant also reviewed the entire exterior of the car with me before sending me on my merry way.  Returning the vehicle was also straight-forward.  Since I had to catch a flight immediately after returning my rental, they gave me 2 options: (1) Call earlier that day and schedule someone to drive me to Skytrain for free, (2) Call 10 minutes beforehand and they arrange to have a taxi waiting.  Since I did not want to risk taking the Skytrain for the first time, I opted for the taxi and they gave me an agreement slip which made the cab ride a $12 flat rate (the meter read around $12.60 so I saved some spare change).  Overall, everyone was professional and friendly and I would highly recommend renting a car from this location.  As corny as this may sound, this is truly one of the best rental car companies I have come across.  One tip: I believe the hours listed on Yelp indicate that they open at 7:30 AM.  However, when I called, they did not open/answer phones until 8:00 AM."

The restaurant was pretty dead on a Sunday evening. Food was just ok. Mexican food. Nothing spectacular.

CE05_kJvl0xRloi8fW6R3w,"Took my car here for an inspection and a load of repairs that I knew were coming (brakes, tires, oil change). I had the tires ordered on TireRack.com (like it suggests on their website) and they were delivered in a day, installed for a reasonable price. Not dirt cheap, but reasonable and better than Firestone or NTB. Unfortunately for my bank account, there were a few pricey additional items needed (catalytic converter, engine mount). Unlike everyone else on here with add-ons, I don't think they were trying to fleece me. The check engine light had been going on and off for some time, which was related to a hole found in the exhaust. With Hyundai Elantras, the exhaust flex pipe is part of the cat, so it was necessary to replace. I double checked what the guys had told me with my own research and found no reason to distrust them. The car had been making some general \rough\"" noises, which I reasoned to be the cracked engine mount.   I also explained my financial situation (poor) and they tried everything they could to help, such as make sure the O2 sensor was no longer malfunctioning after replacing the cat, instead of just replacing it as well. And I'm pretty sure they threw in a pair of new windshield wipers. :-) After the fact, I looked at the parts and labor costs, and found that they were very reasonable, if not better than other places I have been in the past. The car now rides like a dream: quiet, no rumbles, squeaks or other \""rough\"" noises as I mentioned before. Good job Baum Blvd Auto!

CIdyd88FK-4-YaEFo3Ht6A,I have to admit the service was very horrible the last couple times that I flew Virgin America. My flight was not once on time leaving back to Los Angeles. Over 2 hours delay. After boarding the plane I notice that the plane was not even clean. Trash all over the floor area.   After arriving to the airport an hour early we informed the flight was on time. About 15 minutes before we scheduled to board we informed that the flight is being delayed due to bad weather. Either after Alaska Airlines takeover the employees don't care or they are cutting back staff.  For some reason I felt like the staff is less worried about the customers then their job. Over 35 minutes to check in a luggage as overhead bin was full. Then charge a baggage fee. Really?  I honestly have to say Virgin America you lost me a loyal customer.

They def seasoned well long enough :):)   The dippings--- YUK !!! The green one tasted like raw watery grass juice, I had never tasted anything like that before ! N the creamy (looking) one u have to pay extra 50 cents for is just as bad. I can't explaine the flavour it just tasted YUK like grass juice. My bf n I both ditched the sauces aft 1 st try .

I don't think she is being rude by any means , I suspect she is neat  freak can't tallorate partially used tissue/napkin on table siting that it's eye sore for him.

CL_N0WoqaeYFZ1sf4OvtOA,"Absolutely fantastic food. I first stumbled upon this place just over 12 years ago on a trip to Toronto and loved the food. The flavours are strong and the food melts in your mouth! If you love McDonalds or are a picky eater like a 4 year old child then totally skip this place. If you like ethnic food with great taste then this is the place to go. I've been going to this restaurant every year when I am visiting in Toronto and the quality of the food has stayed consistently the same and is as great as it ever was.   Some quick notes about the inside of that place. It is cosy, small and has an intimate feel to it (darker painted walls, candles) with live music on weekends (soloist or duos) - I say weekends because that is the only time I've made those Toronto trips so I have no idea what it is like on a weekday.  Reserve in advance because in the last 12 years from 6pm onward the place is really full and then thins out later after the dinner rush is over.  Menu - read it carefully before you order. I once saw a table of 4 order this garlic mushroom entréee which the menu described as very garlicky and then the whiners summoned the waiter because... you guessed it - the dish was too garlicky. Don't be that knob. Read the menu first.  Awesome food. I'll be there again in a few weeks time!",1
CLthP1yn32xlBswIbsLIjQ,"I've lived in Vegas for 7 years, and when I first moved to town, I went to pretty much every hole in the wall Mexican restaurant looking for a place that could duplicate the taste of my favorite Mexican restaurant in San Diego (Sombrero, if you want to visit them and bring me back a burrito).  After 100 shitty burritos, I gave up on my quest.  Last month, I was on a <occasion>dinner</occasion> break at the World Series of Poker, and I was in the mood for Mexican.  I was driving down the street to one of the Lindo's, and I checked Yelp to see if there were any other decent Mexican places in the area.  <restaurant>El Taco Feliz</restaurant> came up with really high reviews, and only one dollar sign, so I decided to try it instead.  I am sooooooooo happy I did.  I ordered my usual (<dish>chicken burrito with rice and cheese</dish>), and sat down at the connected bar Money Plays.  They had <dish>green sauce</dish>, which was a huge plus.  Another huge plus?  IT WAS FUCKING DELICIOUS!  El Taco Feliz uses quality chicken, and the burrito was a pretty damn close replica of Sombrero's burrito.  I went back 3 times that week for the same order, and I now find myself heading down there when I need my fix.  It's also open 24 hours, though I brought some out of towners here at 3am one time and they were closed.  That was weird.",1
CMCAZVvZlP0ztWo6fhwnGg,Food is fresh and super tasty. They even have a rad breakfast menu. Would recommend stopping by if you're in this area.,1
CN86oDG4uEar1SROyMBKFA,I have never had a bad experience there! Love how knowledgeable the staff are and are always willing to help. You definitely feel like you are in an upscale spa without the upscale prices!
CNGGnMhdwlmO_APP_88yEw,"I really, really wanted to like this place. I have friends who shop here for their pets, and they are very convenient to where I live and work. Unfortunately, I have typically found the customer service to be lacking. I went once with my last dog to purchase something a few years ago, and the salesperson was just so unfriendly that it turned me off from going again. But then with my newly adopted pups this past year, I decided to try again. I thought maybe it was just a one-off experience, or maybe my perception was wrong. And I feel uncomfortable every time I go in. This last time, I had come in to pick up some food that was being held for me, since they were out the last time I came in. That was great, but when I came in, the one salesperson was talking a while with a Customer who had lots of questions, which I understand, and then went to help someone who came in after I did. I just quietly left because I had an appointment. Customer service is everything to me, and I'd rather drive farther for what I need to interact with friendly staff."
CNx_ie_OvjJHZLZ6yEO8UA,"My husband and I stopped  by for lunch.  The food was amazing!  We shared the <dish>lamb curry</dish>.  The lamb was very tender.  The <occasion>lunch</occasion> special had so much for very little price.  We were so full by the time we finished.  The Naan bread,  samosa, tea,  etc was all included.  Very satisfied.  We will definitely be back!  All my friends will be hearing about this wonderful place!  PS: the wait staff was amazing as well. 5 stars all the way!",1
COnqdubhr87gCDJjPGwT6A,"This is my go-to fast-casual restaurant in the Middleton/west Madison area. I wish there were more <restaurant>Freskas</restaurant> in Madison -- I would frequent this establishment more often than I already do.  As others have noted, this is a Mediterranean version of Chipotle. The food is always fresh and flavorful. I've eaten the <dish>classic Greek salad</dish> and the <dish>veggie plate</dish> several times. The veggie plate is full of various flavors and textures and leaves you feeling full even though it includes no meat. The <dish>balkava</dish> for dessert is good, although not as sweet as I would prefer, but I have a major sweet tooth. The <dish>spanakopita</dish> comes a la carte, and the portion is plenty big for a few people to share and still enjoy several bites each.  The restaurant offers a lot of food at a pretty reasonable price. I always leave Freska feeling plenty full, even though I didn't pay a whole lot. I've also done carry-out at Freska, and Freska does a good job of filling up the same amount of food in the to-go containers as it would serve on the dine-in plates. I've noticed that some restaurants really skimp on to-go portions. (I'm talking about you, Panera.)  I still feel that Mediterranean Cafe on State Street is the best place in Madison for Mediterranean food; nobody can top the Mediterranean Cafe's to-die-for rice. But with Freska's convenient location, easy parking and quick turnaround time, I find myself going to Freska more often than the Mediterranean Cafe.  I don't feel as though I can give five stars for Freska because not all of the staff people are always friendly. The two people who have made my orders have always been welcoming and accommodating. The cashiers, though, are hit or miss. Sometimes, the cashiers have acted almost grumpy with me; other times, they've been friendly. Also, I have to dock a star because a menu item at Freska comes with \lettace.\"" ... Cringe ...  Even with the bad misspelling, I'll still go back to Freska!""",1
COwQboVPV9lU1QSdljUP3Q,"They have a great variety of sweets to choose from and their wedding cakes are very pretty,  but as far as taste goes,  kind of disappointing.   The ingredients seem subpar and everything tastes store bought.   Nothing I've had was rich and decadent, like the goodies I expect from an award-winning bakery.   However,  customer service has always been good and I can't say I have ever had anything terrible...",1

As far as the <dish>pizza</dish> goes, it doesn't have as much as taste as nearby Brooklyn South, but it is very good. If crust is important to you, it's better than most.   It's also a unique experience because it's off the main strip in Davidson and you can eat at one of three quiet picnic benches (umbrellas included).   Recommended.",1

CU047MuCn7u-9UGA2-xhmA,"Pittsburgh excels in the arts and the Carnegie Museum of Art is no exception. Your admission ticket covers both the art museum and the museum of natural history which will be reviewed separately. If you are a AAA member you get $1.00 off admission. Admission is free if you attend some of the local universities in Oakland. They honor reciprocal memberships as well. You are given a hanging wrist band which must be displayed while you are on site.  They have a special exhibition on the main floor called the art of Michael Williams which I got to see on a previous visit. Upstairs in the Sarah Scaife galleries you will find different works from middle age European to modern impressionism. There is also furniture, antiques,door panels, ancient Egypt, and sculptures on display. There is also modern untitled pieces. One room has all the paintings \numbered\"" but there is a guide in the middle that describes each piece. The art gallery includes the Hall of Sculpture which show some replicas of the best European artwork surrounding the 2nd floor. The Hall of Sculpture has been used in movies and is worth a look in itself. There is also an app you can download to your phone to learn more about what the art gallery has to offer. I did not get the opportunity to see the Oriental section since it is easy to get lost in the galleries but will do so on a future visit.  Among the artwork I was looking for was \""Road to Emmaus\"" which is the original painting that was replicated in the Henry Frick Mansion at the Frick Museum on Reynolds St. Some of the other pieces that got my eye were \""war bride\"" a portrait of Sarah Scaife, and one of Andy Warhol. The art museum isn't overly large but to cover the galleries in detail takes about 2 hours. Best of all feel free to take pictures. Most museums will allow you to take pictures without flash but here you can use your flash if need be. The museum has a gift shop with various art gifts and if you are into sketching some of the works then you can do that as well. The art museum has a beautiful stairway entrance where you can see a few sculptures or just hang out. Make sure to tour both museums if you have the time because it is well worth the money."""
CV6SRnXZliA9C3PEoIAHSg,"I'm giving them 1 star because I can't give them -100 here. I also hate long reviews, but this needs one:   Last night, my 3 mo. old puppy ate a ton of roasted garlic with the sheath and stem, threw up and was very weak and dizzy all night. I called them up to see if they could recommend a remedy to soothe her belly. It was late at night and my (awesome) vet clinic was closed (VCA Lake View Animal Hospital).  I was connected to a nurse who was a COMPLETE nasty B. She said, there is NOTHING I could do for her and I need to bring her in. I advised her that I did not have a car at the moment and wondered if, again, she had some advice on how to soothe the belly (like a few licks of Pedialyte or fresh wheat grass - which I remembered later).   She just said \nope\"". Literally. NOPE. I asked if she is positive that there is NOTHING in this entire world of remedies, that would help ease my puppies nausea. She said, again, rudely, NO. You need to bring her in, in a tone that made me believe she thinks of me as a complete  idiot. I thanked her for her help.  She said OK (the kind when you really mean \""piss off\"") and then hung up on me!!   Remember, these are the people you are supposed to trust to take care for the life of a loved pet, your best friend. These psychopaths would rather see my dog die from agony than recommend something to ease her pain, just because they want $500 from me, for a completely unnecessary visit. I was so livid with this woman, I wish I could remember her name for this review.   *I gave my pup a few a tiny bit of coconut/almond milk and she was literally brand new in a matter of 15 minutes-spent the rest of the night running around the house like crazy.*   If you love your pets, do not bring them here. All it takes is 1 or 2 people to tell you of a bad experience and that should be enough in cases like this- it's not worth it. I truly hope their clinic goes out of business and that this so called \""nurse' never works in this field again.   Cheers."""

Shouldn't have happened so easily and I got nowhere complaining that I thought the screen was defective to begin with. So I had to get it repaired and informed them that I would consider suing to get my money back.  At which point everyone stopped talking to me immediately !!  Then after getting the repair done I asked for my broken screen back as proof that it was defective to begin with and guess what ?  They refused !!!  Gave me this paper showing it was theirs and I had agreed to it when signing for the repair.  Now why wouldn't they give it back to me as it effectively makes it almost impossible to prove it was defective in court without the part. Sounds very fishy to me. Imagine getting pets replaced at your auto mechanic and then being refused your old parts back. This company didn't get to be worth billions without RIPPING OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE !  I took pictures of my phone from every angle to show no damage to the case otherwise just a cracked screen. CON ARTISTS AND CROOKED AS CAN BE."""

Dr. Rouhani checked my teeth afterwards and chatted a bit.

Randy then drove me home as my truck was being serviced. All during the service I was emailed and texted with updates. When it was done, Randy picked me up and brought me to the shop.

ChF3epc8u657kyhgnKddbA,"I've been all over the valley shopping for furniture and kept coming back to Living Spaces because I like their styles, quality, and prices.  I have been trying to find furniture to make a small bedroom into a sitting room/office. In addition, I sometimes need to nap in my office during the day. A love seat or chair-and-a-half were a little too small to nap on but most of the sofas I looked at were too big for the room.   Ryan showed me smaller pieces of furniture in the main showroom and in the Clearance area. This particular store has a warehouse in the back with discounted items. Since Ryan really listened to what I needed, he recommended a large ottoman with a single, pull-out bed in it. Who even knew there was such a thing? He then asked one of the designers to help me find a chair to go with the ottoman. I ended up buying a Kasen loveseat​ that had been marked down from $570.00 to $126.00. It was in the Scratch and Dent section but there isn't actually anything wrong with it, it's beautiful and comfortable!  I was really impressed with this particular​ Living Spaces store. The customer service was really great and I found a solution​ to my problem that was beyond my expectations. The ottoman (brown leather) matches my living room furniture and I can even roll it out of the bedroom when I need extra seating for a party.   Very happy with my experience at Living Spaces today!  One thing to note...things that are in the Clearance area of the store have to be picked up...no delivery...but the prices are so good, I think it's worth the extra effort."

I booked my appointment online a few weeks in advance - I never got a reminder phone call of my appointment so I literally had to check my online booking the day before to refresh my memory of time. Once I got there which was a few min before my appointment, I had to wait almost 15-20 min to be seen which made me late on my next appointment that I had elsewhere.  The girl who I saw was nice, she was quiet for the most part if it wasn't for me talking and talking to get my mind off of the process  I did ask for a high bikini which turned into what literally looked like just a bikini.. hair was left everywhere! I had to shave the next day because it was not looking nice at all. It wasn't even evenly waxed what so ever I also paid for full legs which should of included toes, and that was not waxed either. When I was about to pay, the lady at the reception was talking to a client on the phone for at least 10 minutes while I'm just standing there in front of her. I always thought the person in front of you should come first before a phone call. It would of taken her 1 min to check me out & she could of continued her call. Just a disappointment when you leave spending a decent amount of money & you don't get what you paid for. Let alone I had to pay extra for parking too since I had to wait so long Don't think I'll be coming back"

CwtjAViLdvXurW67H-7G3Q,Meh. Prices keep going up. The product is fine. But there are definitely better bakeries.
CxE5OE_t29h_wqqK1BsoFA,You would think for the price they could get the order correct. Really? $2 for a piece of cheese added to a burger that was already overpriced. You have lots of other choices in the immediate area. Choose something else. And from now on I will consult Yelp before before ordering. Quality is nothing special.,1

D-Y4sRmHcpukcgKiiYOicA,"I had the most wonderful experience last night! Finally a place that actually deserves the tips that we all feel so obligated to give in Canada. Actually, the waitress went above and beyond what 99% of waitresses or waiters will do in almost any restaurant in the world that this cheap a**hole actually tipped more than 20%. The waitress, Julie I believe, did two things right.  1. She was usually around frequently enough so that you could order on a whim, but not consistently engaged as to become a hindrance.  2.she brought refills on water without being asked, and almost always right after I finished my cup. Typically I consume a lot of water, last night I believe I ended up having 6 cups and every single time she came by with a fresh cup within seconds of me finishing one. It blew my mind that I would receive that level of service anywhere in Canada  Prices are fair too! 2 shot cocktails were roughly 10$ which is very good for drinking outside of ones home. The deserts were amazing. The <dish>panookie</dish> was awesome, freshly baked cookie(or warmed) in a giant pan with ice cream on top, drizzled with chocolate syrup!",1
D07th0gRkq6X5edcNi3oZA,"I own a 2008 Ford Expedition. The AC in the back has not worked for many months. I knew it was gonna be expensive so I basically just suffered for MANY months. It also made a loud screeching noise while running. I was told by various people (not mechanics) that it was linked to my AC not working.  I live no where near VIP Auto. I happen to drive past it one day when I took my daughter to her dance class. I noticed this place because it said Free AC Diagnostics. I knew I need to get my truck looked at because I have been procrastinating too long. Came home, looked them up on Yelp and saw their great ratings so I decided to give them a try by at least getting a quote from them. Scheduled an appointment with EZ and brought it in. Josh took a look at it and gave me a list of what they found and the pricing to fix it. Immediately my husband told me no those things aren't wrong (insert eye roll). After we had a very mini argument in the waiting room that ended in just because you're a guy doesn't automatically mean you know what's wrong. My husband backed down and let me make the decisions.   I'm so glad I stuck with my gut! Josh was great through the whole process! Never once did he ever pressure me. Never did I feel like I was being taken advantage of. Josh, EZ and the rest of their crew did a lot of extras to make sure my problems were addressed and that I didn't drive away with a bandage over the problem. They uncovered other issues and just fixed it. Never asked me for more money to do so. As a woman who is clueless about auto mechanics they never made me feel dumb! And yes, I did take advantage of their oil change special. $12.98 to oil change my SUV!! That is unheard of!  Picked up my truck today. No loud screeching noise, freezing cold AC in my backseat again, and oil changed. They put life back into my truck. I'm very grateful to Josh, EZ and the rest of the crew. Even my husband thanks you!! We will definitely be bringing our auto needs to VIP Auto. Thank you guys!"

D5aSQhj3uyX4Fj1B31EYRQ,"They are big on appointments and as long as you have one you are in good shape.  The service rep Derrick was very good.  The previous visit not so much with a different rep.  I have had my car serviced at Arrowhead Honda 3 times now.  First time service was good except I ended up with an oil stain on my headliner, took care of myself.  The second time just 8,000 miles later(44,000) I was presented with a good size list $$$.  One of the items was the serpentine belt need to be replaced for $$$.  Once I arrived home pulled out the shop light and inspected the belt it was in good condition.  So I do have some distrust with them.  I will give them 4 stars because the work was top notch.  The first time I have owned a Honda and was a little surprised that I needed an appointment for an oil change or how long it takes without one. The dealership was clean and friendly."

D7ekQLESGPsO9zJ2Yy-Dtw,"Im only giving it one star because i have to in order to leave a review otherwise they would get zero from me. We were there gambling all evening when my adult son left his wallet on the machine he was playing. When it wasnt there when he got back to the machine, we stopped security. The security gaurd we went to for assistance literally rolled his eyes at my son, who by the way is of legal age and had been spending money all evening. The security guard was too busy to help us and acted as if we were interferring with his job. He treatrd my son like some young punk which he is not. He was a paying customer just like any 50 yr old would be. They refused to review security cameras too see if the person was still at the casino. What is the point of having security and cameras if the guard on duty is too lazy to use it. Then when we were done after spending several hours and spending alot of money, we asked the bartender for a glass of water while we waited on the bus. We were told no. They would not give us a glass of water even after we explained we had been spending with them all evening. If they cant give there customers who dont drink a glass of water then i will spend my money in a different casino. Rude cocktail waitresses too. I for one will not contribute another penny to this place when there are tons of casinos who hopefully know better then to treat paying customers the way we were treated at this dive."
DAJOaYCxh6Xl4z-RML1LsA,"My best doggie friend is one of the original East End Dog Stoppers. We started taking him there for daycare (and occasional boarding) when The Dog Stop first opened in 2009. His handsome mug even hangs in the picture gallery behind their reception desk which honors their \regulars.\""  When they first opened, The Dog Stop was AWESOME. It was reasonably priced and the staff and the owners knew us and our puppers very well. It felt like he was staying with his second family when he would stay with them.  However, over the years, our experience with the Dog Stop has gradually declined. It seems like their main goal has been expansion, having opened 4 (soon to be 5) locations over 5 years. With such rapid expansion of any business usually comes a decline in quality, and The Dog Stop is no exception.They've significantly raised their prices over the years, which is annoying, but I guess to be expected because now they're equivalently-priced to the other doggie daycares in the area. But it certainly no longer makes them a bargain. Also, they seem to have high staff turnover these days...or maybe just a much larger staff. Now when I take my dog in, most of the staff doesn't know him or us (nor do we recognize them). It used to feel like he was a part of The Dog Stop family, but now it feels like he's just a number (a very handsome number, though). As such, the \""small business\"" charm of this place has totally gone away.   Also, although my dog has never come home sick like some dogs mentioned in the other reviews here, he now comes home from daycare or boarding with a \""kennel smell.\"" This never used to happen a few years ago. This smell must be pretty common for other dogs, because now when you make boarding reservations, they recommend that you buy a \""going home bath\"" if your dog has stayed for a few days (presumably to try to get rid of the kennel smell). A \""going home bath\"" never used to be needed for my pupperoni, even when he'd stay with them for a week or more. Again, to me this indicates that The Dog Stop experience has declined in quality, and I wish the owners would have focused more on maintaining a good doggie experience instead of seeing how many locations they can open in rapid-fire succession.  Another small, more annoying issue that I've encountered as of late -- they are super slow to answer the phone, and will put you on hold and forget that you are there. I've waited upwards of 15 minutes on hold on more than one occasion (the fact that I was willing to hold for that long probably doesn't attest well to how much of a life I have ;)  So, in sum, these days I'd say that The Dog Stop is ok, but not great. And when I'm away, I want my pupper boy to stay and play somewhere great. We've been slowing using The Dog Stop less and less, and I imagine someday soon we'll probably start experimenting with other daycares to see if we can find one with that  \""second family\"" vibe that The Dog Stop used to have."""

We ordered two <dish>pizzas</dish> and they were great. Loved the feel of this NY pizzeria. Prices were right and friendly staff. I am sure if in the area and wanting pizza I will be back.,1
D_7ee6sxfuzfBLYQ_02D2Q,"If Nick shows up at your door to service your washer or any appliance....SLAM THE DOOR.  Totally incompetent and a loud mouthed slob as well.  So our home warranty Company, First American sent this guy out from  A-Quality Refrigeration, and after telling us our GE washer and Dryer was junk....then our built-in GE Monogram was junk...could not explain way our washer was not getting water but said he would order PARTS? A week goes by and nothing...so contacted home warranty company on Tuesday...week later,....and informed A-QUALITY never contacted them to order parts? So, called GE SERVICE yesteday, showed up today and replaced panel and we paid $314.00....they felt sorry for us and gave a 50% discount. So, it gets better!  Nick showed up at 4 p.m. .....did not cancel that appointment to see if he had a clue....but....came with wrong parts and was CLUELESS.  He was ticked off at ME for not letting him know it was fixed in the a.m.....jerk...wrong parts....would have waited another week without a washer if Nick could ever figure it out????  Don't use NICK or this Company...tell your home warranty company!"
D_xNKV64LYNl4QcGa2fytQ,"I gave this place 1 star because the only good thing is the bed is comfortable. This place is probably hell. In fact I am convinced it is hell. It seems like I have time traveled to 1998 as I walked into this room. It smells like 1998 too. The maid is the most annoying person in the world, she stood outside my door for 30 minutes talking about her sex life. I almost threw up. I shouldn't ever know how her vagina works. Sadly, now I do. As if that wasn't annoying enough, there's no point in having a do not disturb sign. They will completely ignore it and come back ever 15-25 minutes to ask if you need anything or just try to walk in your room while you are sleeping. Even though you've told them for the past 4 hours you won't be leaving until later in the evening and you will call when you want the room cleaned. The shower sucks. The room is so creepy I am waiting on an axe murderer to pop out from under the bed and get me. Seriously, don't stay here unless you want to experience hell. Yes, it is that bad."

Dd3HtEQnKG1HYSNTYdfwug,"This is great pizza hands down. We used to order the thin crust pepperoni classic and a cheese for the boys every Friday night. That was until we tried the deep dish now we get the <dish>'Monster'</dish> . Yes it may cause an early death but you can't eat very much because it is so good, rich and thick.  They pile on a red sauce that is like chunks of near fresh tomatoes, under the sauce is a beautiful mozzarella that is great and stretchy even after delivery. Lots of meat and olives - amazing pizza.  The <restaurant>Rosati's</restaurant> near us is only delivery or carry out. Oh, and this is no $5 pizza - you get what you pay for.",1
Dd9l9bDHbACessxl-Ks4UA,"We tried the <dish>ice coffee</dish>, <dish>peach tea</dish>, <dish>Viva las Elvis waffle</dish> and the <dish>Breakfast Waffle Sandwich</dish> with Turkey sausage instead of bacon.  Overall the coffee was better than McDonald's, 7eleven, dunkin iced coffee but I didn't enjoy it more than Starbucks. The price was also a bit higher. This is just my personal taste preference but my opinion nonetheless.  The breakfast sandwich was alright but didn't come with any sides like salsa. Also the Viva Elvis didn't have butter but was acceptable with the toppings. The tea was freshly brewed and I admire that.  Overall I would not give this place a second go anytime soon as what they offered wasn't out of this world or a game changer. I have had far better homemade waffles and coffee in my time and seeing this is the bread and butter of the business it should exceed all others and then only add to the greatness with other optional dishes. The place could use a bit more outdoor seating, however the place is in not in the largest area for seating options.",1
DdDJN5ZMmjyWTtPsU9YBJA,"Not a good place to live at all.     The staff is only nice until you sign the lease. They nickel and dime you on everything. The grounds are not well maintained and getting worse everyday.   I had a water leak issue and it took almost a full day for maintenance to respond. Any apartment that isn't on the top floor will hear every step from above them louder than you can imagine.  When we left we were never notified of our final fee until it was sent to a collection agency. The collection agency did not call me, but Liv Northgate gave them my father's phone number , he is dieing of cancer but had to get yelled at by a collections agent. I paid my total balance and was still reported to all 3 credit bureaus.   I am in the process of obtaining legal counsel, so unfortunately I am not done with Liv just yet."

I had my ps4 sound like a jet engine taking off after a certain time of playing and especially with those intensive games such as Uncharted 4 and Doom. After having my baby at the shop for general cleaning and replacing of thermal paste and also the fan, it ran quieter than I could have ever hoped for. I swear it's quieter than when I bought the thing. And they live up to their name of affordable, too. Be sure to tip them! They're literally the best in the biz."
Der6cNgKbShEMR2jry1Tmg,Nice and clean because it is new. Very pricey and the whole socks thing is stupid. You have to buy there socks for $3.50 a pair. My 8 year old daughter had holes in both of hers on the seam on the top of her foot in about an hour.   Went back up and they said you have to buy another pair. If you are going to require tour socks then for god sake make them decent. For $3.50 they should last a couple trips not one hour.   For the money and how you are treated for that money I don't see many people doing this more than once.   $57.48 for two kids on a Labor Day weekend special.   Highly doubt that we will be back any time soon.

DiZPJEv35VOjdtJgU9gJTQ,Will never visit this establishment again. I made a special trip there on Saturday August 15th around 3:30. There was a lady already there being served and another customer waiting at the counter. There was no greeting or communication that we will get to you soon.  The lady being served was ordering a ton of  items and had never ending questions about items in the showcase. This went on for quite awhile and I just got disgusted and left because there was another staff person there who was aware there were two other customers waiting.  This second staff person was at the front counter when I arrived but took off to the back food counter and busied herself there.  It's nice to know customers are not your top priority.  This was my first and last visit here ever.   There are many other excellent bakeries where I am not subjected to this type of neglectful customer service.
Dl49Zc2Mp1MTb_pLLQ0RtQ,"I enjoy ordering my cakes from this particular <restaurant>Safeway</restaurant>, and this past weekend was no different. I was a little worried as I was ordering a very specific birthday cake that I need on Saturday October 24, for a friends birthday party. She basically wanted a <dish>strawberry shortcake, cake</dish> (you know whipped cream frosting, fresh strawberries in the middle, strawberries  and whip cream on top). When I went to Safeway on October 19 after going to 3 other locations to attempt to order this cake, Miss Frida informed me that they were currently out of strawberries and wasn't sure when they would get their shipment in. All I was thinking was its Monday and I don't need this cake to Saturday and there is a chance that Safeway wouldn't get a shipment of strawberries? But its MONDAY and I don't need it til SATURDAY is what my mind was screaming. Alas I took it all in stride as Miss Frida told me not to worry and that she would call me on Friday if for some reason they didn't get any strawberries in time and that we would work something out.   So after having a mini panic attack as I had already been to 3 other places in the last 48 hours and was tired of cake shopping but I was determined to get the type of cake my friend wanted. So Friday rolls around and although I had not heard from Frida, I decided to stop in anyway to see what the progress was. She let me know that that had received a fresh shipment of strawberries on Thursday and that everything was a go. Needless to say my mind was instantly at ease.  So fast forward to Saturday, I pick up the cake, which looked fabulous and headed on to the party to finish setting up and getting everything ready for all the guest. When it came time to cut, the birthday girl was beyond happy and let me tell you, that cake was OFF THE HOOK! Talk about fresh. My goodness. Everyone loved the cake and couldn't believe that it came from Safeway. The birthday girl was happy as she got exactly what she wanted and the guest loved it. Hats off to Frida for making one hell of a cake and to Safeway for not letting down!",1
DlFKsdGY7-7c4u7_A-W99Q,"<restaurant>Bakery & Kaffee Haus</restaurant> (originally BakeryHaus) is an European bakery shop that originated in Vienna, Austria. The company started as a distribution business, supplying baked goods to many grocery stores and coffee shops before its expansion to a retail space. The shop itself is a small storefront located inside of the quiet Queen Live Market. Besides coffee, Bakery & Kaffee Haus also offers an assortment of baked goods from donuts, cronuts, cookies, macarons, and more.   One of the coffees that they offer is the reasonably priced <dish>nitro coffee</dish> ($3.99). It's essentially iced coffee that is treated with an odorless nitrogen, and served on tap. The drink from Bakery & Kaffee Haus was rich, creamy, and goes down smooth. Definitely a coffee that will keep you energized all morning.  I also got to try one of their <dish>cronuts</dish>. There are three flavors to choose from; original, chocolate, and nutella. I opted for the chocolate cronut ($3.25), as it looked quite good to me on display. Personally, prior to my visit to Bakery & Kaffee Haus, I never tried a cronut before, so I didn't know what to expect. What is a cronut? It's a pastry hybrid of a croissant-doughnut created by Chef Dominique Ansel of NYC. The cronut from Bakery & Kaffee Haus had a nice crispy yet flaky texture of a croissant, and completely covered with delicious chocolate topped with nuts.  I also couldn't help, but tried one of the macarons available. I ended up choosing the <dish>pistachio macarons</dish> ($2.49), which was pretty steep for the size. However, the macaron was really good with a nice crunchy exterior, and creamy filling that wasn't overly sweet.",1
DlVALLr6P4_cimALTHjcbg,"This store has lots its collective minds.   How many times are you going to \re-organize\"" the store? Its like an easter egg hunt every week now trying to find stuff. The whole point of returning to the same grocery store is being able to run down the isles and actually FIND what you are looking for. I saw that you guys actually offer a store map/directory now at checkout so clearly - LOL - I am not alone in this. Umm, Walmart is a lot bigger and has no such thing so hmm.   Even a clerk I grabbed had no clue this last week where 2 things on my list were now being kept. With a list of 8 staples I managed to find 2 and while staring down a long line opted to just leave empty handed and shop another day.  If there is some type of amazing sale on something that goes live at 501am you had better just load up your cart early and keep moist by the cucumbers while you wait or your likely to find the shelf empty. I often wonder if they are just hanging Sale signs over empty areas of the shelf to make it look like they have more traffic. I am sure I'm wrong but forget underwear gnomes, Kroger gnomes are on their game.    3 stars just for being my local grocery store and having some very cool staff members."""
Dmk0ofuT-ZBjNmKhZ3qK-Q,"This place was absolutely terrible. I went for a Canadian soccer game since this is supposedly one of the best places to watch. I guess I will never understand why Canadian soccer fans choose this place as their go-to. The place is terribly laid out for these purposes with small or unclear TV's and cramped spaces. But on to the actual service and food.  I sat at the bar and was ignored for about 10 minutes while the 2 bartenders served numerous people about 2 feet to the right of me. I was finally greeted and I asked for a menu. After looking at it briefly, I was then ignored for an additional 10 minutes or so. I ordered a <dish>beer</dish> and a pound of <dish>wings</dish>. The beer came in an unclean glass and was poured improperly (had absolutely no head). The wings came and were not honey garlic, they were medium.  As I was sitting at the bar, I then got to hear the one male bartender be an annoying jerk for 2 hours. Complaining about how hungover he was and how he needed a cigarette. When one customer had the nerve to ask him what beers they had, he actually said \Don't waste my time, it's busy, I don't have time for this.\"" He then gave him a beer menu and walked away.   As someone who works in the hospitality business, this is hardly the service one expects in a restaurant. I recognize this is a pub and not exactly a classy joint, but I see no redeeming qualities in this place. If even the beer is terrible and you can't get even the most basic of orders correct, what business do you have staying open?""",1

DrBS0F5mbkQ-DfE3weMqzA,"My previous review, prior to move out, was generally positive. Living at the complex was fine. The pros - quiet, decent office staff, plenty of space and storage, beautiful grounds, unique floor plans, close to North Mountain Park.  That being said, upon move out, I must tell prospective tenants to think twice before renting here. I was willing to overlook the cons because all apartment complexes have their weaknesses. This one is in a sketchy area with very interesting individuals. Parking is extremely poor. The gates are always broken. Maintenance does the best they can and respond quickly, but expect to have the same appliances and fixtures repaired several times over.  And here is the kicker - upon move out, we were hit with a $229.50 fee. After two weeks of communicating with office staff, the breakdown is as follows (according to their email):  \You failed to professionally clean your carpets; the oven, stove, top of the refrigerator, cabinets/shelving were dirty,  and there were areas that were not touch up painted at move out.  Unfortunately, per your move out guidelines, every resident is required to leave the dwelling in good condition. 8/17/2014 Carpet Cleaning - 85.00 Apartment Cleaning - 80.00 Touch up painting - 60.00 + Tax 229.50\"" I requested pictures of their inspection several times via phone and email, but no one returned my calls or sent me the pictures confirming this. I finally spoke to the property manager Sarah, who explained that tenants are expected to prepare the units for the next tenants, including painting, professional carpet cleaning, and full cleaning detail. With this review, I would like to include the inspection pictures staff took in order to show that the unit was in better than good condition upon move out, but Sarah has yet to send them, even after repeated requests. My sister and I lived in this unit for two years and maintained it very well. We spent several days cleaning the unit, using Magic Erasers on nearly all surfaces prior to vacating.  As tenants, we had no disciplinary issues, no complaints, never paid rent late, and were always patient with staff when packages were lost, fixtures and appliances broke several times, and even when my small dog was attacked by a resident's pit bull (which is banned from this complex) and no action was taken for well over a month. If you are planning on signing a lease here, please think twice about it. You will be hit with additional fees upon move out, poor treatment and customer service from staff, and total lack of respect and communication regarding the fees. On top of this, they are threatening to send our bill to collections should we not pay it by 9/17/14. Unfortunately, because they refuse to send us the pictures of the unit, I refuse to pay the fees."""
Ds_cXAeAYZYgX_Wrsbep-Q,"So happy I found this place on yelp. I've been looking for a long time since I moved to Phoenix for a good color and cut.... and that doesn't cost me $200. This place fits all the check marks. I loved my color and the cut is great. I saw Nicole, she was super patient and really listened to what I wanted. She showed me how to style it and gave me lots of styling tips! I'm so sick of other places charging $50 for a haircut AND another $25 for blow drying.... I mean it's part of the cut. This place does not charge you extra for the damn dry :) Anyways, the ambiance of the salon is really nice and fun, the people are super friendly, and most importantly Nicole did a great job and I will be going back for sure!!"

E626TM8-_3v7mPjnbYj2Kw,This place sucks. Made me wait an hour before anyone came to help me and when they helped me they more concerned with some of my other teeth I wasn't having problems with. I went in with a sharp jagged pain every time I bit down and none of the 3 dentist I spoke with there seemed to have any interest in my pain. I have a few cavities but those weren't what I was concerned with. They did not doing anything for the tooth I was in pain for and instead set me up for an appointment for a filling the next day. I canceled the appointment the next morning because I didn't want to get a filling on that other tooth I wanted the tooth I was having pain with fixed. They ended up charging me a $100 cancellation fee and now are pursuing it through court and sent me a delinquent notice stating they would deduct it from my paycheck. The fact that they don't have enough business here to pursue after this makes me wonder how they have a business at all. I would not recommend them because of their poor service and lack of care for their patients.

I went in the following day and showed a photo (a picture is worth a thousand words, but clearly not here). I wanted some blonde put in at the end of my hair and blended to my natural colour. Sounds easy enough, considering I already have blonde hair. The first girl that did my hair, Mya, simple bleached the bottom of my head. Literally stripping all of the pigment out. It was a straight line across my head that looked more like I had simply dipped my hair into a can of white paint than a \professional\"" hair job. I was devastated, to say the least. Asha, who was extremely kind tried to fix it and did her best..apologizing along the way as she went. Clearly she was aware of the mistake that was made. It still looked awful but I wanted to get out of there and paid $150 plus tax. The following day I called to explain to the owner that I was still unhappy and that I would like at least some money back so that I could get it properly fixed. Well, you can just forget trying to reason with that woman. She is rude, condescending, and appears to me that she is slightly emotionally unstable. She was extremely emotional and accusatory and her tone made me extremely uncomfortable. All she did was blame the other salon and ask why I came to Pure Salon anyway.

This is so spicy but flavorful with a bit of sweet at the end. I'm a hot sauce snob and this sauce left me wanting more. I ate the bread with it and almost finished the bottle.   Highly recommend blue ribbon.,1

E9YrPcoz_USW31ZBIiMeMg,My husband ordered a <dish>carrot cake</dish> for my birthday because it's my favorite.  They decorated it with carrots  but made the frosting birthday cake frosting (very weird).  I would rather have cream cheese frosting and forget the carrot decor on my birthday cake.  The cake was VERY DRY!!  The cake layers were THIN and the super yucky frosting between the layers was thicker than the cake.  My son took one bite and said he hated it.  I took one bite and was shocked at the frosting.  My second bite realized the cake was too dry to eat.  No birthday cake for me after my husband had gone to all that trouble and was so excited to surprise me.  Our kids were so disappointed!,1

EC6xUsmzvVqRD2sdcE1kNQ,"Shame on you Walgreens ! You are a profitable multi million dollar corporation. Invest in staffing up and training your employees. Today was not the first time I had to wait in excess of 30 minutes on the drive thru prescription pick up line.(  you get sort of trapped because there are two lanes and with a person in front of you behind you and beside you, it is impossible to get out of the queue. )  when I finally got to the window and asked about the delay I was told that they were \compounding\""  an rx for someone and it took a lot of time. Excuse me manager and staff - has no one there a heard about time management and efficiency and customer service protocols? Did no one think that perhaps the customer waiting for a compounded prescription should be asked to pull around to the front of the store and told that a pharmacy tech would bring out the prescription when it was ready? That way the waiting customer just waits in another area while the other four cars in line do not have to wait for 30 more minutes and  there for Customers just waiting to pick up a bottle of pills could be serviced in a timely fashion. Two months ago I had another incident when I could not get through on the phone, was left constantly on hold, simply inquiring about whether I had left my credit card at the store. I finally drove back To the store only to be screamed at by a pharmacy tech. Personally I will be transferring my prescriptions to another pharmacy as well as writing to Walgreens boot alliance  CEO and board members. Having worked in hospitals and healthcare all of my life  under far more stressful conditions,it is remarkable to me that clients can be treated so Callously and disrespectfully in the pharmacy environment."""

Aside from the high quality of the service, I appreciate her attention to detail. She obviously cares about her craft and it shows. I also appreciate the little touches like sending an invite to my iPhone calendar. I was used to barber shops, so I was little apprehensive about going to a salon environment, but now I wish I'd found Deana sooner. Small premium in price compared to the barber shops I frequented, but well worth it."

ERjRWDwIxJWDBJfuWbo4wg,"A warning to Cox customers:  Cox Communications called me on Monday offering to upgrade me to their Ultimate plan. I told them I was at work and I needed to talk to my wife before purchasing anything. I let the sales agent give me her pitch and explain all the options. I specifically said I was open to it but needed time to decide. She said no problem, she would set up the order and I could confirm or decline it. Great.  The next morning (Tuesday) I receive several emails telling me that my monthly charges are going up, they're going to install a Contour TV cable in my house, and they have already mailed me a panoramic WiFi modem. I confirmed NOTHING. I go to work that day thinking I could sort it out later. My wife texts me around noon saying a Cox technician is at the house installing the cable and the WiFi has stopped working.  This is when my work day was interrupted, again, this time for an hour over the phone with four different Cox agents.  This is when I learn that the plan we were on before, Premier (150mbs down), was phased out two years ago and we were grandfathered in.  This is when I learn that they preemptively changed the modem on their side, invalidating our existing modem, before they even delivered us the new modem that I didn't ask for. I guess they assumed we'd be okay with going without internet for as long as it took to ship the new modem.  This is when I learn that when the sales agent went against my wishes and signed me up for the Ultimate plan (which would bump our rate up by $45/month) we permanently lost the ability to return to our original plan. Instead we have to downgrade to 100mbs down at $5/mo. less. Besides being a horrible deal, they have cheated us out of their obsolete plan and taken up hours of our time. We have to return the modem and the Contour TV stuff to the store once it's mailed to us, and I will soon spend probably another hour over the phone telling them that they have lost two customers.   If you're on the Premier plan, watch out for calls from agents offering to upgrade you. Don't let them get two words in because they will upgrade you regardless."
ES64p4ZlDPKv-ZUEB7Tv2g,"I miss my other great clips already... this one doesn't feel nearly as welcoming and the staff didn't seem to have interest in chatting with clients like any decent place would. The lady that cut my hair was very nice and friendly but didn't say a peep during my cut other than questions about my hair.  Anyway... my biggest gripe was the lady that cut my hair was using a $20 clipper set that was probably bought at walmart. The size guides were plastic and came in a variety of colors. I'm sorry but that just shouldn't happen at a professional establishment. Every professional should have a nice set of clippers. It's the principal of it more than anything.... yes, she did a good job on my hair but it just doesn't feel like you get the same type of cut with plastic cheap clippers. I didn't notice if the others were using the same but the staff at the great clips i frequented by my old apartment definitely had better equipment."
EU4HmQDjBxZ5hDQHaLy3Iw,"I don't know where to start but it has been a veryyyyy long 3 weeks since we took our dog here, first we decided to take him Here based solely that it had such good reviews, I really wished we hadn't taken him to a place that I personally didn't know of anyone that had actually gone there. Take make a long story short we asked them not to take much hair off cause its winter and we like him long, much to  our surprise my husband didn't even recognize our dog when he went to pick him up cause he was shaved down to the skin. He was shaved so low that by the time we got him home his skin was pink and very irritated all over. We have it a few days to settle down and instead it got much worse.. We ended up taking him to the emergency vet that sat. Where he had a scrotum infection from razor burn from the groomers. He had to be put on 2 weeks of antibiotics and a head cone. Obviously we went back to them to share our frustration that a simple grooming has now turned into an emergency vet trip. The owner didn't argue about what happened and covered our vet expense so I appreciate she stood behind that, however she wouldn't refund the amount of the grooming and we are now 3 weeks out and have had to take our dog back to he vet 2 more times at our own expense due to complications from all of this. I have spent many long nights trying to nurse my little guy back to health and deal with this whole situation. I can't believe what an ordeal this has turned into."

EVCfPjUEleykI_s6dY4p3g,"My intent is not to harm Scott's business and his work; although, I feel the need to provide an accurate review because our experience was far below professional and quite frankly, really pissed me off. Obviously I hired Scott for good reasons:  his 5 star Yelp reviews, the small business, how he sold his work and the price. However, I would never recommend his service. Despite the initial positive interactions, Scott ended up to be unreliable, dishonest and did not complete the work; leaving us without a care and a mess to clean up. Furthermore, as our interactions progressed he increasingly made me feel uncomfortable and unsafe. I am appalled at his behaviors and actions, which I have described below.   I met with Scott on a Thursday regarding a major trim of two mature trees, an Ash in the front and a Maple in the back. I scheduled him for the following Tuesday to accommodate our holiday weekend schedule. Later Thursday evening, he pressured me to start the following day, Friday, stating he could get the job done in one day. As it was a good hustle, I agreed to let him begin the job.   Scott showed up late on Friday morning in a Lyft stating, he \does not drive\"". Throughout the day, Scott had to leave several times, utilizing ride share the entire weekend, to obtain tools to complete the job. He did not finish the job on Friday and asked for half the money up front. Scott was given permission to finish the work on Saturday, again stating he could get it done with one more days work. Noticing the tree limbs that were laying in the front yard cut like firewood I asked what his intent was. He stated he \""donated\"" the wood he cut on Craigslist and I told him we were interested in keeping the wood. Additionally, Scott took several large items out of the neighborhood bulk trash to use as tools and stored them on our property in the front of the house.   On Saturday, Scott not show up until after 2 PM and had to leave again to obtain tools to complete the job. He worked until after dark in the backyard, not leaving until approximately 8 PM. He discard the wood in the front yard without our permission or further discussion about an interest in keeping it. Scott left his supplies, tools, trash and recovered bulk trash on our front property. He also did not clean up the debris from the front tree. Scott was informed that due to the holiday, he could not work on Sunday or Monday, and would need to finish the job on Tuesday when originally scheduled him to begin. Scott still planned to return on Sunday to clean up the front yard and was given permission.   Scott did not show up at all on Sunday.   On Monday, Scott retrieved his tools from the front yard for \""another job\"" and planned to return on Tuesday to finish the work as planed. However, he later text and asked for another portion of the money to purchase a tool for the other job, adding that he would do extra work for it; which in the same text stated he was \""going to do [the extra work] any way\"". At this time, I was 100% concerned about his behaviors and actions. He was informed that he would receive the reminder of the payment upon completion of the job, which he was given one more day to complete. He apologized for his request and planned to return the following day, Tuesday, before 9 AM to finish the job.   At 9:15 AM on Tuesday morning, I text Scott to see if he was planning on returning to the job. He replied that he was unable to finish the job at this time and would return to pick up the remainder of his belongings. He was informed that he would not be receiving the remaining 40% of his payment and would need to remove his belongings from our property by 5 PM. Scott never returned to my home and left small tools, supplies, trash, bulk trash and an entire front yard to clean up.    The following weekend, it took us an entire day to clean up the mess that Scott left in our front yard and pull the half trimmed branches from the trees."""

I received 6 bids and while Fresh Coat was not the least expensive of the bids, I felt the best about Julio and his commitment to excellence. Not to mention, their reviews on AngiesList and Yelp were the best  compared to a few other companies.  Sometimes you pay a little extra for better quality and it is well worth it.

Specifically I've had most of my transactions with Jay and Chris. These two gentlemen are the perfect example of what having a passion for cycling really is. I'm a beginning rider and I never once encountered the least bit of annoyance from either of these gentlemen when I asked the fifty thousand questions I had lined for them. I had been to other cycle shops around the Henderson and Vegas valley and none of the other competitors had customer service that was as outstanding and or personable as Jt's. I work for the service industry and Jt's Service is what we would refer to as 5 star 5 diamond rated.

I liked it in fact compaired to other locations I have been. It took me but a second to get everything I needed from the front counter to start my brother off on sending his first rounds downrange. My only complaint is that caswells is a bit on the tight, closed in space list and I felt I did not have adequate room to comfortably situate my self and my brother to shoot. Other than that I cant complain, fun shooting! - Note if you have kids and want to introduce them to shooting.. look for a different range, with a much greater space to do your thing.

I admit. i have been on Cedar Plank grilling (thanks to Sam the Cooking Guy) kick for weeks but now... Now I think i'll take my talent to Stir Fry cooking.   I came in looking for some fish sause, and whole Red Snapper and THAT'S all! Yelp (welp) after I walked in while the owner held the door open for me, I was met with the pungent smell of fish (?????) Now I know where they came up with the name.  Pretty nice place (this isn't my 1st checkin even though the app said it was) that has about 3 or 4 rows of seasonings, tea's, canned goods, noodles, etc.. They have a lot of different fish. Clams, Mussels, Oysters etc.. (I have been on my clams, mssls, oys. kick pretty heavy as well).   They have a Numbered sign that goes from 1- taking the scales off all the way up to 10 (i believe) that takes the head off, fins, etc.   oh yeah, I did pick up my fish sause, seasame oil, a jar of sliced ginger, and MY whole  RED SNAPPER.. less than 17.00. Its just waiting for me to get home and bring my talents with me!!  Cheer's to the gift of Giving and the Blessing of recieving, To eat like Men and to Drink like Fish!!"
En1CTNrIW0klhRDTpiBXOw,Joni is the most amazing color specialist! I came here to LasVegas a few months ago and went through two hair salons that completely destroyed my hair. I thought it would take forever to fix! One sitting with Joni and my hair looks gorgeous! She is a color genius the color she used for my hair is beautiful and exactly what I wanted. I have never had color this beautiful! Not only is she a color genius but she knows what she is doing she has amazing experience and will not do you wrong. I would trust her with anyone you wont be let down if you need her to fix someone elses mistakes or just to do your hair and make it beautiful!

Luckily, we were pleasantly surprised, and this spot was quite efficient and handled the crowds well.

Ep-SYYvdHJ9xnXy5B-OSMQ,"I'm sure this particular store is adequate if they have the item you want in store/in stock. If they don't and you have to order it to be built and delivered you should look elsewhere. We ordered a recliner and two sofas in February 2018 and still don't have the sofas (July 23, 2018). Everything from their customer service department takes 5-7 business days to get you an answer. That answer has always been \we can't locate your order\"" which only happens when you call them again after they fail to call you back. 5-7 business days. Essentially the same supply chain management as the Pony Express. We were told in mid-May that they would give us 30% off if we didn't cancel our order. Then they called back a couple days later to inform us that the \""leadership team\"" meant 30% store credit (however that works). 30% of never buying anything from West Elm again is a pretty shrewd move so we requested they honor the original quote. But we won't get that either because it's now six months after the original order and we've gotten used to just standing in that room and we're finally going to cancel. One final note, the accounting department doesn't have the same 5-7 business day issues as the rest of the company. They were outstanding at billing the credit card the minute they said the sofas shipped in April. If only they had."""

Et2k7A5-OaHPj2Qt2xRWXg,Had a bike in for repair after an accident with an SUV. After the repairs they said the front wheel had a slight wobble but I wouldn't notice it.  It certainly was more than slight. After taking the bike to a real bike shop I found both the front and back wheels had a wobble and cracks in the rims and the bike was unsafe to ride until I got new rims. I found the help at Build a Bike with a definite unfriendly attitude.

Nobody told us anything, which would have helped, as we waited for another hour for some cars to get brought up.  Finally, I was jokingly offered a 12 passenger van because they did not have enough cars.  Since I was tired of waiting I decided to take it.  At the last minute they managed to find me a normal car.  When I got to the garage, there were dozens of cars available and four people just sitting around in a booth!?  I have no idea how this company has managed to stay in business with people like this working for them.  AVOID!"""

ExD6juQhcCbw_u8lwksJdQ,"Performance Automotive & Tire Center has been maintaining my son's car for several years; he always speaks highly of this business.  Recently my daughter, a single mother without, sadly, a trust fund....found that her car needed extensive maintenance. She took the vehicle to Performance, since her brother has had such excellent service.  The reason I'm writing a review for service I did not directly receive is simple: normally my adult children might look to their step father and his mechanical expertise (he had his own transmission and repair shop for many years.) However, we have moved out of state. So when my daughter needed repairs, she found exactly what she needed at Performance. They gave her an honest estimate, did the work promptly and charged fairly.  I know how few really good, honest repair places are available. My reason for making time to submit this review is based solely on appreciation: my daughter and her children are no longer riding around, hoping for the best, in a vehicle badly in need of repair. Thank you! I hope the maintenance technicians know how deeply grateful I am for their expertise. And a special thank you to Bill, who I gather may be a manager at the Mesa shop. If he isn't, maybe he should be:) He was very patient with my questions and open to make time to give me an estimate for additional work. He was also honest in his assessment of the need for that work.  Clearly, a Five Star rating!"
ExDoe_SQbsBhUNJSzYetIw,"I have been going to Stacy for years and I have never had a better hair experience! She listens to what you want and provides really helpful feedback to ensure you understand what you are asking for and what the results will look like. Not only does she make you feel 100% comfortable, she also does an amazing job!   I get my hair done every 6-8 weeks and I seriously get compliments even on the day I am about to go in and get it redone! She knows just how to cut it so that even when it is growing out, it still looks like you just got a brand new haircut.   Stacy has taken me from red, to blondish, back to my natural color with highlights in between. One time, I made a horrible mistake and requested something that I ended up not loving. This was ALL my fault, Stacy did exactly what we discussed - I just didn't love it. She happily fixed it on the spot, even thought it was my mistake and not her mess up. She is that good - instead of leaving in tears or going home and secretly hating it, she made me comfortable enough to express my feelings and make sure I left loving my new 'do.   I recommend Stacy to everyone, you will not be disappointed!"
ExoqgA3aAz6bYidI0DSQvw,"<restaurant>California Sandwiches</restaurant> always delivers, I love the Chesswood location, and I especially love the original down on Clairmont.  They all do exactly the same thing but they each do it with their own little bit of style. This York Mills location tends to go a little thicker on the veal and a little heavier on the chopped jalapeno heat, but once again they make a delicious customizable Italian sandwich.  My go to order is a \<dish>Hot Veal Sandwich</dish>\"", with provolone, and occasionally with some mushrooms or some sweet peppers. With the \""hot\"" representing not the fact that they freshly fry the veal cutlets to order, which they do, but referring to a generous helping of finely diced roasted jalapeno which brings the spicy Heat! You can always order it \""medium\"", or \""sweet\"" for no jalapenos at all, for the timid among you.  None-the-less, it's a great sandwich, great service, and always delicious - never any complaints.   Nice job California Sandwiches!""",1

That night cover was $5--I paid the money, was stamped and handed the woman my coat. I realized I hadn't paid the $3 coat check fee, so I handed her the additional $3. She subsequently asked me for the $5 for cover. I tried to explain to her that I had already paid and showed her that she had stamped my arm. She refused to listen and repeatedly told me I had to pay $5 to go inside. (I feel like I should also mention the place was empty when I got there, with no line behind me).   By the end of the encounter she had pushed my friend who was with me and I lost $8. We left and I won't be returning.",1
F-bdXFkJwwENiNpMTG2ntQ,"A mediocre spot by Yonge and Dundas to meet up with friends or go out after work.  You would think being a \brewery\"" and brewing their own beer that the beer would be something above average, but it was really nothing to rave about. The food is also average as well. I split the <dish>nachos</dish> with some friends and we all agreed it would've been more worth our time and money to make better nachos ourselves. Some other friends ordered different items and for the quality, the menu seemed over-priced.  A good thing about this place is the atmosphere - it's pretty lively and the place is fairly large (multiple levels) so there is lots of space and seating.  Service was decent given the size and busy-ness of the place, but the food did take a while to come out.   If you are looking for something easy and centrally located, this will probably do the job, but other than that it's very average.""",1
F06m2yQSPHIrb1IT7heYeQ,"The food is good... but the organization and customer service is terrible and proportion size of food is inconsistent. Mind you...we are regulars and it's after the 3rd time the same thing happened that I'm sitting here with my elders complaining and disastisfied the entire meal that I am writing this. Not a pleasant dining experience if you ask me.   We are the first party to arrive and our waitress sees more parties rolling in she advises us to hurry with our order so we can get our ticket in first.... after she puts it in more parties continue to arrive and sit down. Then both chefs took turns walking out to greet the table next to us (they walked in way after us)... and soon as the food is coming out... about 4 tables (all who came after us) got their food... some of which was also on our list. The waitress  helps us ask and she said they thought they already made everything on our list.... well okay then but when our stuff comes out its made half assedly compared to other tables and wasnt even enough to give each adult 1 piece. We had 7 adults and the dish only had 5 pieces of \fresh yam\"" (not even a premium ingredient). Also 2 of the dishes we ordered was distinctively less than the last time we ordered it... and for the price it really didnt seem worth it. All the waitress could do for us was apologize and say she can't say anything to the chefs or she will get yelled at.   What's worse is that there is no management on staff and no one could address our issue. And some other waitress who isn't even servicing us butts in to say we can't help you we only deliver the food as it comes out. Not like we can give you their food.... (but like i mentioned a few of those things were the same ones we ordered.)   I really hope someone takes the time to read this. Its the third time the same thing happened where everyone after us gets their food and our table is forgotten... all we hear are excuses and no compensation for our wasted time. We brought our kids to dine too... we were lucky they had more patience tonight than most nights. We really like the food and flavors you make but we will not be coming back for a while. Good luck.""",1

But I just discovered this week a new reason to love <dish>Tammie Coe</dish>: the boxed lunches.  For around $10 each, I ordered lunches for my fellow faculty members who were having an in-service at the Phoenix Art Museum. There were about 10 different sandwiches to choose from, and about 4 salads, and they all came with a drink, chips, and giant cookie. Everyone raved, and many asked me from where I had gotten lunch. The salads were huge and the sandwiches were hearty and very satisfying. Everything was clearly labeled, and packed into individual brown bags for each person. I could make special requests like \no nuts in the cookie\"" and the woman in  charge, Sia, was a pleasure to work with. I felt that I got a great value for my group, and will absolutely use Tammie Coe again for my smaller catering needs.""",1
F2KO-6OpG6F6Hg722IrgOA,"The only other <restaurant>Barriques</restaurant> I've been to is the one on Old Sauk and this one is probably double its size.

The wine selection actually seemed pretty extensive, with multiple aisles along with the wall of wines like the Old Sauk location.  I got a <dish>honey lavender latte</dish> which was pretty delicious (there were random honey spots on my cup though so that was kinda annoying ). And the staff was very nice so I suppose I went during a good shift since I didn't encounter the subpar staff that other reviewers have mentioned.   With respect to parking, I guess I got lucky. I parked in the small lot (6 spots total, I think) right by the door and I imagine someone had left just few seconds before I got there.

Not appealing. And maybe I'm old fashioned but I prefer that my food-prep and servers wear clothes. If you have hairy man-boobs and arm pits, a low scooping tank-top is NOT acceptable.

F5hWxFlXpidnq7_7DMU54g,"The Uptown Ampitheatre is an awesome outdoor venue to see live music. Last year, I saw the Kansas/Foreigner/Styx concert here and on Wednesday I saw the Spank Rock/LMFAO/Ke$ha concert (my taste in music contrasts quite a bit, clearly). Both concerts were exactly what I wanted. Lawn tickets for the Styx concert were 30 bucks, the tickets for Ke$ha were 35 bucks and we were in row 23 for it. The view, regardless of where you are in here, appears to be really good. The sound is awesome, not to loud, but still really nice. The prices for concessions are obscene (water bottles are 5.00 each), but that's a given at a concert.   The only challenge is getting to the place. Getting to the Ampitheatre from Plaza Midwood is a challenge that requires lots of loops and turns and roads that make no sense to go on to go in that direction. Drop-off is very easy though."

I'm not sure if the portions were smaller due to restaurant week, and I personally left pretty full, but a bigger eater might be left wanting. The desserts here were standard, good but not mind blowing. My tiramisu was creamy and fluffy without being too sweet, though it came on a solid chocolate base that made it a little challenging to eat. I did appreciate that they had espresso options as well as French pressed coffee. Service overall was very attentive, and the employees all looked genuinely happy to be at work, which is a huge plus.

I'll start by saying I was having a great time for most of the night. Good music and a very good pint of <dish>Guinness</dish>. But that changed around 1 am while I was waiting to order a pint. There was a woman at the bar who pointed out to me a leak in the ceiling and a bucket underneath that was collecting the water. She was very drunk and I was trying to not to engage with her because I didn't really understand what she was saying at first. I was not bothered in the slightest about the leak. But she kept going on about how dirty it was. She then tells the bartender that the bartender will have to pay for my beer to \teach her [the bartender] a lesson\"" about the dirty bucket. At this point I realized the drunk woman is either the owner of the bar or at least a high level manager.   Anyway, she kept saying that I will have a free beer at the bartender's expense and told this to the bartender in front of everyone at the bar. I said this would not be necessary and it wasn't a big deal. I felt extremely uncomfortable because I didn't care at all about the leak and would never expect the bartender to have to cover my beer for it. I have worked in the service industry and this felt extremely unfair and degrading. I didn't want to make a scene so I decided that I would pay the bartender for the beer later when the owner wasn't paying attention. But before I could leave the bar, the drunk owner says \""well aren't you going to tip her?!\"" And I was very confused because her whole tantrum was about me not supposed to be paying for a beer. She says \""well do you not tip your bartenders?\"" So I, feeling even more uncomfortable than I did before, take the change out of my pocket and put $1.50 on the bar. The owner says \""is that it? How did you plan on paying for this Beer?\"" At this point half the bar is staring at me and I feel utterly humiliated. I take out a $20 bill and the owner says \""oh so you do have money, he'll have $16 back please.\""  After this I walked around to the back side of the bar as white as a ghost. I then waited for the owner to not be paying attention and gave the bartender $5 for the remaining price of the beer (which was $9) as I didn't want her to be out any money personally. She reluctantly took the money and I thought we were all good. I should have left after this but thought it had been settled so I stayed. Unfortunately, this was not the case.  The rest of the night the bartender refused to serve me. I asked for a beer at one point and she said \""I'll get back to you.\"" She the proceeded to serve the entire bar. I waited patiently and she finally said, 20 minutes later, \""sorry we're done, I'm not serving anymore.\"" She then proceeded to serve at least 5 more people. I kept waiting patiently and she finally came over and said \""sorry I don't mean to be a bitch but we're done serving.\"" This was all one hour before the bar's closing time. I looked at her and there was a very clear understanding that this was due to what had happened and I guess I got blamed for it. Again I felt humiliated. I don't know what's going on behind the scenes at this pub but what I do know is that no one should ever ever make customers feel as uncomfortable as I felt. I've dealt with difficult customers before and would never treat the most obnoxious customer the way I was treated. And I don't even think I did anything bad or wrong. I tried to do the right thing. Maybe I messed up somewhere along the line, I don't know. But I really did try and be respectful and courteous the entire time. Make of this what you will, but I left <restaurant>Hurley's</restaurant> feeling like trash.""",1
FBKC1Xw59-RfkkyGYNbIig,Favourite family restaurant in Richmond hill. Joe is a family man who knows all of his customers and makes a point to give you service with a smile.

FDEm-c3NAXnTVtl-hgzAhA,"I heard about this place from some of my friends and of course on TV. So when I had the chance to visit AZ, I just had to hit it up, since I LOVE burgers.   As you walk in the door, you are greeted by good looking girls in skimpy nurses outfits. When you are seated, everyone must put on a hospital robe before ordering. There are even mirrors behind the counter that are angled up for a view of the waitress's sexy nurse costumes. So far so good....   My expectations were very high but they did nothing but disappoint with their <dish>burger</dish>. Their all you can eat <dish>fries</dish> on the other hand were absolutely amazing (I even went back for 2nds).   They do have a great concept here, but they just have to work on their burger recipe.",1

FJoXrkLaLh76MgHXKdJJFw,"I walked in with a few friends which I have done many times before. I greeted the owner and bartender by their names then we ordered drinks and my friend went to the restroom. After about 10 minutes the bartender asked where my friend was. We told her that our friend was having an upset stomach and that he was probably just going number two. This immediately started chatter between the owner and bartender. It was obvious they were talking about us.   The owner knocked on the restroom door multiple times. The bartender made several comments to other patrons about how our friend should \poop wherever he ate\"". When my friend emerged from making fudge dragons the bartender said \""I hope you cleaned up after yourself\"".   My friend was humiliated. I was embarrassed for the owner and bartender as they were prying, invasive, rude and childish. I've never had an experience like this anywhere else. I would endorse this place as having a decent beer selection but don't be surprised if they make you feel guilty for using the restroom.""",1

At first I thought the service was great having my food ready and prepared within two minutes. After taking a few bites I noticed that the meat, lettuce, and even tomatoes taste old. The lettuce was soggy, the meat was hard, and the tomatoes were not fresh. It seemed as if it was prepared earlier in the day. To top things off, the food did not sit well in my stomach in the night. Very disappointed in <restaurant>Greek pita</restaurant>. Take the time and make fresh food for your customers!   I will not be returning. I will take my business to Greek wraps instead.",1

FLlnY8jtMuU0h8trqgQfhw,I will never go here again!!!!! I called this morning to verify drop off time and if I needed an appt to bring my daughter in....I was told no appt needed just bring her in....so I did....just to be told as I am checking her in that they won't take her because even at 21 months she has to go in the 1 year old room and needs a reservation... (when I told the girl my daughter was 21 months she said 'well the computer says she is 1 year 9 months........?!?!) This is the third problem we have had with them..the first two times we were overcharged for daily drop off....I thought I would try them one more time but that was a huge mistake...I was an hour late for work and my daughter was upset because she wanted to stay and play.
FM0h7JHdthhnc50vgGWzpA,"Good place for a casual night out with friends. Unpretentious and very reasonably priced! I came with a friend - we ordered a bottle of <dish>wine</dish> (they have great selections for only $35), the <dish>shrimp appetizer</dish>, <dish>meatballs</dish>, and <dish>jerk chicken</dish>. Shrimps were big and the dish is crunchy (comes with 3!); really nice start to the meal. Meatballs were good, but the real winner was the jerk chicken. It's really spicy and flavorful! They pair it with a lightly sauced slaw which complements it well. They no longer serve ice cream sandwiches for dessert which was a bummer, but we were pretty stuffed! All that and our bill only came to $40 each.  The owners, two sisters, are also the bartenders and servers; although the place is small we found they needed at least one more server to keep up. Also, as we were only a table for two, they put us by the door which kept opening and closing and made us a bit chilly. Wouldn't be the placement for a large group but I recommend eating at the bar if you're planning to go with 1 other person on a busy night.   Ambiance was amazing and the music selection was spot on! Will definitely be back.",1

I am now waiting on the fourth attempt to get them to fix what was the original problem. I mean some of the issues are just ridiculous for a company to have such as having to call them back several times to get simple answers. Its hard to find a good plumber but cheap does not always make it worth the headache of dealing with one of these companies. I normally do not talk bad about a company but this is not what I would expect from a company with good reviews. The plumber that came over did it fast and walked out and then came back, did it fast and walked out and here we go again. Believe me or don't I just had to speak my mind."

FQDoxOKH31URBSGLTYNCXg,Oxygen bar was a fun way to socialize and get a tens massage while resting from walking all day. The oxygen part was just ok but the tens massage felt amazing.   They definitely do sales pitch their products which doesn't bother me. I actually did buy the tens unit because it felt awesome.   Definitely recommend going with friends even if it is just for the gimmicky nature of it.

FStFa2esHFgsAjVzIGJcQA,"I should have read the reviews on here prior to purchasing. I ordered a bed set for my daughter. In the store the manager tried t reverse every sale that the sales lady was giving me and basically forced me to buy the protection plan or else the price would increase dramatically. He also did not want to sell me the set with the trundle included which it clearly said online it was included. It took several weeks for this to be delivered. This is for my daughter since I'm expecting another child in a few weeks and need her old stuff in the babies room. They delivered and set it up today and the footboard was damaged so they need have to order a new footboard. Also they keep calling my husband about everything when his is just a backup number, and I have told them numerous fines. They can't tell me when the footboard will be here or delivered until tomorrow so the bed is halfway set up in my toddlers room.   My first experience with them, I went to pick up a chair that I bought and they gave it to the lady that came in right before me. I had to wait several hours for her to come back so I could take it home.   Very unsatisfied customer and will not be shopping here again."

FUhJLCocwgZEiVn1Wg1KSg,"Don't stay here if you can. Or if you absolutely have to make sure you don't give a cash deposit even though a credit card deposit takes 3-10 business days to get it back. Cliff the general manger ( or as he says the owner) talks to people in a very condescending manner. He has refused to give us our $200 deposit because he said we didn't pay for the whole stay.  The situation is we had to extend our stay 2 times. We stayed a while at this broken down, half way remodeled, smelly hotel because we were waiting for our house to become ready. Cliff and no backbone John said we owed money for the hotel fees or room charge we owed for the previous reservations when we finally checked out.  If we owed money on the previous stays shouldn't have it been taken care of when we checked out and checked back in?? Also, I'm not sure which front desk attendant didn't put that we transferred the deposit over. But they didn't do their job which made the whole situation blow up. At first we were told we just needed the recite to show we were owed the deposit. After maybe 15 20 minutes of me searching for the paper I found it, gave it to the front desk attendant. Then we were told about the unpayed hotel fees and room charge. So all in all shell out the extra money to stay at a different hotel. They say they are going to remodel but if I was the Owner or general manger (guess that's the same thing now a days) I would just burn the place down.  There is a lot more to this story but we will just handle it in civil court  Ohhh. Almost forgot. Don't argue or say they are wrong in any way. Cliff will call metro (coward..literally shaking from his hands to his penny loafers) if you disagree. He told the police my fiancé threatened him.. I know it's going to seem like I'm biased but there was no threat. There was a \you idiot\"" but no threat. All in all just say away."""
FUr2uEolARu7rv2TQYKPqg,"I think <dish>Za's</dish> is a good idea for an Italian restaurant. I like the different menus to customize your order, but it is really wasteful for every person that orders something to use a sheet of paper. I sure hope they recycle them.   Unfortunately the food has been marginal at best. I've tried multiple pizzas, pastas, and salads hoping I'd find something that works but no luck. The only reason I kept returning was because it's sort of a \tradition\"" for my coworkers and I, but I've decided to not spend my money there when I can avoid it because I end up having to force myself to finish as much of the plate as I can. The portions are always far too large, but many people (Americans) will see that as a good thing.   I can see this place being popular on campus when you need something filling and fast, but otherwise it's a pretty mediocre restaurant.""",1
FVY75lAgzS4BKFPnZ8oHeA,"We live in the neighborhood and been there quite often. It used to be ok, a reliable place, not too fancy but efficient and pleasant. But now you just have to avoid it. Service is surreal. Invasive waiters trying to please beyond rationality, mingling into private conversations and filling your glasses every two seconds (clearly the objective is to boost the tap and hence their tip). Yet unable to write a correct order down, leaving the table unattended while ordering. Huge wait between dishes, with kids waiting 1.30 hour before getting any food (the waiter realizing that they offer kids menus after 30 minutes, bringing them an slowing down, once again, all the process). Food ok, standard brasserie fare, but then ugly dessert straight from the fridge. And if it is Saturday, a stupid techno music as if it was a club. You ask for volume to be turned down, just to be able to have a conversation, and after 2 minutes is up again. It's a brasserie not a disco! Kitchen clearly overwhelmed by patrons. And they even tell you, \sorry but tonight it is a mess\"". No manager in sight capable of taking any responsibility, offering an apology or a partial reimbursement as a courtesy.  DON'T GO THERE!

Fa0eq4Gwl8Tuc168Sm1rpA,"Now I said I would update this review once I attended the Subway Fresh Fit 500. Well here goes and I am going to tell you EXACTLY what you need to do if your coming to this racetrack. First let me start by saying the oval is a mile in distance and there is not really a bad seat in the house. I sat in the AJ Foyt section Row O Seat 10....great view of pit road and the actual track itself. Now with that being said let me get to my original point.....here again is EXACTLY what you need to do if your planning on coming to a race at P.I.R.  First....and I can't stress this enough.....if your over 40 and NOT in tip top shape buy a parking pass....let me repeat that..... buy a parking pass....because the walk from the general free parking lot is more than a notion folks. So again I don't care how much it is BUY THE PARKING PASS....so you can park as close to the track as possible. There is also an option to park and ride at one of the local hotels for 7 bucks for everyone in the car.....that is an awesome deal. Let me make that clear that is 7 bucks total....NOT PER PERSON....again an awesome deal.  Secondly if you decide to park in the general FREE parking lot areas please take Litchfield road and just follow the signs around to the racetrack. It will take about 10 minutes to get to the track but there will be 3 lanes you can use because they let you use the shoulder as a lane. HOWEVER here is the problem with that....they don't tell you exactly where you need to be and the guards from the Sheriff's office and the local Police Dept. are horrible. Here is what you need to remember if you want to park at the very back of the general parking area in hopes of getting out first then use the lane on the far right (shoulder) because they block of each section of the general parking lot based on what lane your driving in. If you want to park about middle ways then make sure your in the middle lane....and if you want to park in the first section of general parking closest to the track use the lane on the far left which is also another shoulder. I highly recommend if your not in good shape and don't like to walk to far to take the FAR LEFT LANE as you approach the track. However let me advise again BUY THE PARKING PASS or PARK and RIDE.  Next if you do plan on parking for free then get there EARLY....I can't stress this point enough. 9 maybe 10am is the latest you should arrive or you will regret it. If you stay for the entire race you will discover why getting there after 10am will cost you dearly. Let me put it this way....the race on Sunday was over at 4:30pm or so and even though we parked in the rear in hopes of getting out early.....we didn't get home until 7:00pm. That's right I said 7pm....because we were in the lot for over an hour waiting to get out. So again get there EARLY....EARLY....EARLY. Gates open at 8am....so you have no excuse.  Buy your scanner ONLINE and you will save yourself 10 bucks GUARANTEED. Now you will have to go to will-call and get a plastic looking credit card and then you will have take that to one of the MANY scanner vendors and grab your equipment. You will receive the scanner with video if you select FANVISION....a pair of headphones....a charger...and an extra battery which you probably won't really need if use it only when the race starts. If you rent from Racing Electronics you will get everything I just mentioned except for the video portion. These are a little cheaper to purchase and to rent so that is a nice option.   The nine or so rows of steps that lead over the major parking roadway near the vendors is totally ridiculous. You would think that all the money that over 130,000 plus people bring to P.I.R that they could at least build an escalator and just cover it. If that doesn't work just remove it all together because again for those not in the best of shape this could cause you real problems. So once you come down on the other side everything else is pretty awesome about the place.  Most of the popular Nascar Drivers have a vendor trailer selling everything from T-Shirts to collectibles. You then walk through gate 3 or gate 4 and then just find your seat. Now be advised they are very serious about what you can and CANNOT bring in there....so make sure you call....or check the website before you arrive so you won't be disappointed when you show up at the gate. There are air cushions for sell and for rent as well as some pretty decent seatbacks. The food and drink prices are a bit steep but not unexpected if you attend tons of sporting events like I do. I must say to be totally honest you really shouldn't be spending money on food anyway because they let you bring just about anything edible into the track area. That also goes for anything to drink because they let you bring soft sided coolers inside as well.   If you remember all of these things....you should have an awesome day at this track....I know I will NEXT TIME. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!"

Fejwokv8mYx1B4R0Z8KiBA,"I cannot in my wildest imagination understand how any sane person could rate <restaurant>P'karos</restaurant> with 4 stars or greater. In our experience it was pretty mediocre.  Wandering Yonge street looking for interesting dinner options, We too were intrigued by the idea of trying Venezuelan cuisine.  First don't be fooled. This is a fast food snack place not a restaurant. Complete with blaring sound track and. 24/7 TV.  Alas the Venezuelan offerings are very limited, about 7 options. The main choices are burgers. And not very good ones at that. While no one should ever expect a burger outside of home to be good (they all have to cook them to a sad grey death) they don't have to be frozen industrial hockey pucks.  amazingly little deep fries starters were both still room temperature in the middle. (and salty!? Wow!)  I was the only one to venture onto the V menu ordering the Patacon (i believe its called) <dish>pulled beef on fried plantane</dish>. Not bad but $13? Really? (and Venezuelans do not seem to be big on vegetables - there were nine in sight.) it was worth $7.  1 starter, 6nasty \salty\"" (that's how it is on the menu) <dish>cheese sticks</dish>, 2 burgers, my Vez. dish and a <dish>water</dish> and <dish>pop</dish> = $54. I can get mediocrely for half that.  Venezuelans must also like their food salty and this all filled the bill.  Interesting too the 2 adults suffered crushing headaches on returning home. MSG maybe?

I chose the <dish>Mango Curry</dish>, per recommendation of our smiley waiter. Man, he was constantly smiling... maybe he was overly happy to see us? Nonetheless, he sure was friendly.   The mango curry was okay. It had chicken, shrimp, squash, and other veggies. The size of it was not the biggest...and it.. wasn't spicy. :P I kind of wish it had more kick. I did enjoy the mangoes though. My friend liked the <dish>pad thai</dish>.   Not super authentic dishes, but if you're having that semi-thai food crave, definitely stop by mint.

Definitely recommend choosing the <dish>Fried rice</dish> or <dish>Manchurian rice</dish> as it has more flavour over the <dish>Biryani</dish>.   Again, the wait was long on the day I visited.

FlUimPjl-6AkZk0neebkWA,"If you are a woman do not expect to be treated fairly at this establishment. My husband has purchased tires from the Glendale Discount Tire location for years without a problem and thought they would treat our 18 year old daughter fairly and with integrity. Unfortunately he was wrong. My daughter' s car had a slow leak in her rear driver side tire that needed to be patched. We had just had new tires replaced less than 6 months ago by Discount Tire, but the salesman still tried to up sale our daughter on new tires saying the tire could not be patched. Our daughter called home to get guidance and we told her that this didn't sound right and to have the repair man put the tire back on and to come home. Discount Tire refused. Long story short my husband had to drive down to the store and of course the manager of the store started back pedaling and wanted to then make amends.  Very disappointed in the Glendale Discount Tire Store; this is 2015 not 1950. Get some respect and treat everyone with integrity in the future!"

FnBlRWBuvJQXB3D91_VIkw,"Just checked this place out for a visa photo after consulting the all-knowing Yelp. It sure was rapid, alright, and if I were in the business of rating local joints based on the promises of their creative store names, I'd have to give a 5. But of course, we Yelpers always look for so much more than speed!  Maybe I'm old-fashioned (side note: I'm definitely not) and maybe I'm needy (introspection: ...possible?) but it was rapid to the extent that I felt I was being rushed out so that the three women in pink-polos behind the counter can go back to their daily chit-chats. They were prompt to pause their chats to serve me as soon as I entered and friendly enough, but I walked out wishing I got a little more warmth and time of day. BUT, I realize this no hassle, in & out business is what many look for, especially on the PATH corridors.  The photo quality appeared to be nothing extraordinary for the price. It was nearly $14 for two photos after tax - which, call me old-fashioned again - was a little bit of a surprise. Perhaps I'm just dreaming in a delusional universe where Toronto sans inflation and rising costs of living can still enjoy cheap eats and services.  I would check them out again if I am in a rush, but will probably look around for other Passport photo spots if I've got the time."

FrQ-ibgyStNevDtit9WT0w,"Major fan of Ulta right here, and this Ulta location in pretty Westgate Plaza didn't disappoint.  I'm obsessed with dry shampoo and swear by Sexy Hair's version of the stuff, which is fantastic for simultaneously freshening the hair and adding volume.  The major downside of dry shampoo is that it's not conducive to flying:  dry shampoo is an aerosol powder, and pressure changes associated with flying in an airplane ruin the product the majority of the time.  Thus, if I'm flying somewhere and staying for more than a couple days I hunt down a place to buy Big Sexy Hair Dry Shampoo.    Enter Ulta.  Stopped by this Ulta location while in town a couple weeks ago to score some dry shampoo.  Was interested in a travel size version of the stuff, but an Ulta employee informed me that the only small cans of dry shampoo in the store were Oscar Blandi brand.  Alright, I'm down to try new things.  The employee explained that the Oscar Blandi product specifically for brunettes is great because it doesn't create the fine white film associated with most dry shampoo brands (true) and adds serious volume (not true at all).  I paid $11 for the little can of Oscar Blandi product but in hindsight would gladly have paid $16.95 for the full-size Sexy Hair dry shampoo that I love so dearly.  The Oscar Blandi dry shampoo frankly didn't do its job, and I didn't like its lemon Pledge-like scent.  Though the advice I received regarding the dry shampoo was inaccurate, the service my friend and I received in this nice clean store was overall good and friendly."

FxLfqxdYPA6Z85PFKaqLrg,"My girlfriend and I literally came here by accident one night not realizing that the old StonePepper's Grill that had previously been in this space had closed. We thought the menu looked expensive but were too tired to go elsewhere. I mention the prices specifically because this restaurant was charging prices in line with places like Il Pizzaiolo or Bistro 19 and delivering Olive Garden quality food and service. I ordered <dish>pizza</dish> and actually enjoyed it (no doubt the old wood-fired oven from StonePepper's has been put to good use). My girlfriend, however, ordered <dish>tortellini</dish> that she felt she could have cooked herself. She also ordered a glass of <dish>wine</dish> that didn't arrive until we had finished our meal. Our waiter was a nice guy but was either new on the job or lightly stoned: he never actually took a drink order, my girlfriend prompted him for the wine. Also, she was apparently supposed to get a salad with her tortellini but by the time we realized it we just didn't have the heart or energy left to bring it up. There is an Olive Garden 2 minutes up the road from here and a Bravo 2 minutes down the road and regardless of your feelings about those chains at least eating at the chains you can feel confident you will get what you pay for.

The <dish>sushi</dish> was decent, not anything special.  I felt as if our server was trying to get rid of us.  She brought the bill immediately after clearing the table, and said \take your time\"", but then about 15 minutes later basically showed up at the table with the POS machine.  For the record, this was a Sunday night and it was nearly empty, so it's not as if we were taking up a seat that they could have filled with someone who was waiting.

GI9nWATB9s_1ECMSNnXEJA,"We had never been to <restaurant>Hef's</restaurant> despite 3 years of frequenting the Park Rd shopping area. We've now gone twice in the past month. Why???  First they got us in there with an Entertainment Book coupon for buy 1, get 1 dinner. Sweet. Then at that first visit, they gave us each a VIP card to come back for a free beer every time we visit after 10 PM (in December 2011, you can get your free drink any time of day!).  So of course we came back for our free beers. The free drink doesn't even have to be a Bud Light or cheap domestic beer, you get to pick one at the time you get your card, so we both got a free <dish>Highland Gaelic Ale</dish>. Not too shabby. Combine that with their Happy Hour (until 7 pm) 40 cent <dish>wings</dish> or <dish>cocktail shrimp</dish> and you've got more than enough reason to go check it out.

Movie will cost you $10 here and $7.50 during the day. Popcorn is great without butter and the theater always has the newest movies available. It's a regal cinema, so if you have the free club card, you'll save some money from time to time. Since it's located near South Park mall, it makes for a good place to split up friends and family when they're in town. Some shop, some watch movies.

I can tell you that my dog loved her little cake ($14 for small) and I also purchased her a beautiful collar. If you call 2 days ahead, they can personalize a cake for you. They also have dog brownies, cannoli's, cupcakes, etc. Perfect for gifts!   My only (slight) concern is that on the website, it says something about what they put in the treats/cakes. One of the ingredients they list is garlic to aid in digestion, which to the best of my knowledge can be toxic to dogs in certain types/quantities. I'm sure they only put the appropriate type/amount in the treats, but probably best to not give to puppies. For more info about garlic and dogs, please see here: http://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/garlic-for-dogs-poison-or-medicine/  Overall, I really liked this place. The staff was more than friendly and helpful. My dog didn't get sick or upset with any of the treats/cakes we got her. There's also a beer shop next door, so I think next time, we'll both get treats and eat/drink on the patio. I'll definitely be back, thanks again Canine Cafe."
GLVahCssTKPBY_06LzUGQA,"Stopped in just before closing (they were already in mid-process as the store was empty) to satisfy my doughnut craving.  Staff were so nice and not at all peeved that I was meandering in for the first time and needed a minute to choose.  Oooh, such yummy choices!  I chose an <dish>apple fritter</dish> (nice size, good but not fabulous flavor - needs more apple and a skosh less bake time).   But the service!  I mentioned it was my first time there, and they gave me not 1 but 2 fritters AND another <dish>doughnut</dish> of my choice just for coming in.  I chose a glazed buttermilk and it was really yummy - better than the fritters.  They're so sweet - every pun intended - that I'll definitely be going back to try other options.",1
GMrwDXRlAZU2zj5nH6l4vQ,"Pho has long been my cure for a hangover and it is vital to know where to get a good bowl of Pho in Vegas to do the trick and cure that hangover.  Overall, this place is good.  The <dish>Cafe Sua Da</dish>, <dish>Spring Rolls</dish>, and <dish>Banh Mi Sandwiches</dish> are legit!  But, the service and the pho could be a little better.  My suggestion would be to get something more than just a regular <dish>Pho Tai</dish>.  It definitely isn't bad and I would still go back to this place but I left still feeling a little empty.",1
GMzBNH0IoE3kYFH6dnAm0g,"The day before I came to this pool, I went to BLVD pool and I must say I liked this one WAY better.  Now maybe I am biased because I am a 80 year old curmudgeon trapped in a 30 year old's body but I tend to like to relax on vacation and am not after the whole party scene (at least not at the pool).  Pros: -great service.  There were a lot of servers running around.  I will say that it took a while to get the attention of mine.  They don't really come up to you.  You have to make the first move but once you do they will be by quite frequently.  I mean my server knew me by name and made sure I was taken care of.   -get a daybed if there are at least 2 of you.  It's worth it.  I spent $80 on 3 drinks, chips and guac and watermelon.  The F&B min for the daybed is $150.  Makes complete sense. -the food and drinks were fantastic.  The <dish>Tequila Mockingbird</dish> was one of the better Palomas I've had in Vegas and the <dish>guacamole</dish> was SOOOOO delicious.   -the chairs were being constantly monitored by the staff and when people leave someone comes by and removes the dirty towels.   -the pool itself was easy to be in.  Great lounging in the water kind of pool with 1 foot deep ledges and floating chairs.    Cons: -it is smaller so if you don't get here at the right time there might not be seating.  My first chair was in full sun (105 that day, iPad totally shut down) but one opened up under the pergola and it provided a nice shade and misters.  I've read quite a few reviews saying there is no shade and that's not what I found.  It i,1s limited and gets taken very quickly so there's that. -you can't bring your own food or drinks but honestly no one stopped me bringing in my smoothie"

GRs6OxKZREAwA_Nmp2GmVw,"I had a <dish>carnita taco</dish> and a <dish>bean tostado</dish> and both were MASSIVE! The taco itself was large enough for a <occasion>lunch</occasion> meal and it was reasonably priced at $2.95. It was packed with plenty of meat and set inside a double corn tortilla. The meat was fried crispy which is the way carnitas should be prepared. Very flavorful pork and piled high. The bean tostado was very large as well, but there was too much lettuce and the beans were just average. In any other part of the country these would be considered good beans, but in Arizona they are just average. Overall a great value stop for lunch and I'll definitely be back for the menudo (only served on Saturdays and Sundays)",1

The flowers are incredible, the landscapes are so complex and interesting, and the Japanese garden is amazing in the fall with all of the lanterns. If you are planning a trip to Montreal, make sure this is a stop on your way and hopefully you'll be here in the fall for the lanterns.

There was 5 employees there, not one acknowledged us. One lady was cleaning the glass, the other cooking, and the rest appear to be having a conversation through their headsets. We stood there for 5 min waiting for someone to say something. Worst customer service, what's wrong with these people?",1
G_wqVaqV3TBsZPAIIRCU-Q,This location has always been my location of choice. Nice and clean! Very impressed with their ever growing selection of organic produce. Great wine department as well. Only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the seafood department is lacking especially with wild caught fish.
GcccANcTwZQt-OTLlesYvg,"This place is good for the price.  I have the black membership that allows me to bring an extra guest with me every time, and gives me access to their \amenities\"". I hardly use them though, because I don't tan and I don't use any of the other stuff they have available.  This place has a good selection of machines, although I would LOVE to see them reduce the number of treadmills, elliptical, and bicycle machines to add extra benches for free weights. Sometimes there isn't enough room for everyone to do their workouts and people end up taking the wights from their designated area and don't bring them back. which is kind of a hassle because you have to go hunting for them or skip your workout. It would also be great if they had more space for stretching, their stretching area is quite small, and with the traffic of people on certain days, and the new member coming in, the place is pretty crowded and, again, people end up taking a mat from their designated area and they don't bring them back.  but like I said, it's pretty good for the price (weather you do the $10 month to month, or the $20/mo with a year contract)  oh! and be warned: I've encountered several judgmental bitches that look at you up and down just because you don't happen to be wearing a a pound of makeup and fake lashes to do the bare minimum like they do. NEWSFLASH: some of us actually want to get fit and will sweat our asses off. ok, rant over hahaha"""
Gd3kalpiBR-3WbvtgDiOnQ,"Such a unique experience! I love that the lotions and scrubs are all homemade in-store. I was very happy with the experience and my pedicure. I found the cost a little pricey (but I'm new to the area), but I believe it's almost expected of a salon with such distinction."
GdCRQU3VCh_x8fY84mbwYQ,"This is not a sit down. Its a pure play Afgani fast food Joint. The place is super busy - people just do not stop coming in. Be it for take out or eat in. The ambiance is not charming - A picture of the mountain range, another of Bamiyan Buddha's and the picture of a lil girl with blue green eyes which is now the poster child of afganistan - the food however tries makes up for it a little.   We had <dish>Choppan</dish>, <dish>Chaplee</dish> and <dish>Chicken kebabs</dish>.  Each dish comes with Nan and Salad(tomatoes, lettuce topped with garlicy mayo dressing). The nan's are good so are the meats - tender, juicy and succulent. The chicken is just ok.  It would be better if these guys offer a kebab platter no rice no salad.  Another thing to try for the curious cases is something called the '<dish>Firni</dish>' - A rice pudding which is not all that bad. Actually its the only place where I have had 'Firni' just the way its supposed to taste like i.e. w/o any graininess of the rice. However the one served here is a over sweet.  Last thing - DO NOT wear green t shirt here else you'll be asked by someone to clean the table like I was :-)",1
GdV24nwlR29MPqNXFglZnQ,"I've never had a bad experience here, but I've also never taken the drive thru.  I thought it was common knowledge that the drivethru everywhere is slower than going inside and ordering, plus you get to save on your gas mileage.  Any way, this place is great with it's little fireplace and TVs and WiFi.  Inside everything is modern and automated which is cool, and I've always received my food very quickly.  I recommend for any fast food place, to go inside and order.  You may also meet a nice person!",1

Gf40Ghm5UXOPjyeURX7s8g,"I was in Medina last weekend for my best friend's wedding.  The night before, a bunch of us went to Sully's and it really captures the essence of the Akron area.  When we were walking in, there was a biker festival across the street and a bunch of gruff looking guys in a band singing the national anthem.  Classic!    Once I walked in, I found more bikers and a sweet irish live band.  A decent sized bar with awesome Great Lakes Brew Co craft beers on tap, Sully's offers a comfortable spot with a VERY diverse group.  We saw everyone from kids in their early 20's to senior citizen couples all boozing it up.  What else do you expect in Akron?  The best part of the night was getting my tab.  I bought a round for the group earlier in the night.  For 14 drinks my tab was something like $55.  If I ever (and I don't expect to) return to Medina, I'll be spending another Friday night with friends at <restaurant>Sully's</restaurant>.  Awesome spot."
GgfGB1yadYSHaNYrzaO1_A,Walked in after work and greeted shortly after. I know it's late and I appreciate that I was fitted in right away! Plus they have a small fridge stocked with water bottles and some snacks.. tv is on and they have coffee too.  I am very pleased

GkF0aKUFrmVQhDCfWetG3Q,"I went to <occasion>lunch</occasion> here twice in a week with my coworkers. Because it was a holiday week, there wasn't any wait for a table both times. I have walked by during lunch where there is a pretty decent wait, so keep that in mind if you are on a time crunch. The first visit I had their \<dish>traditional</dish>\"" with scrambled eggs, bacon, seasoned potatoes extra crispy, and an english muffin. When the food arrived, it came with toast by mistake, but the server immediately brought out the english muffin, so no issue there. The staff has always been courteous and friendly. The eggs were good, light and fluffy, the bacon was nice and crispy, and the english muffin was what you would expect in an english muffin and came pre-buttered, so if you order one and don't want butter make sure to ask ahead of time. The potatoes were not super extra crispy, but again, that seems to be the case with most places. Even only slightly crispy, the potatoes were tasty. Overall I have had good consistent meals at this location since it opened.  The second lunch I had the elevated egg sandwich. This is a simple goto sandwich I have had before. They were accommodating of my changes, which was no mayo, and for the egg to be over hard instead of over easy. This time the potatoes were extra crispy and were still delicious. A simple lunch that hit the spot before a long holiday weekend. The only real issue with <restaurant>First Watch</restaurant> is that it is pretty expensive for what you get, but it is still a nice treat for a lunch every now and again.""",1

GnZ0VSACXC0J4Pg2mxTT1A,"<restaurant>Hop Central</restaurant> is a brand new craft beer mecca with 36 beers on tap including at this point in time one of there own - a decent not over the top IPA.  Roughly 1/3 of the taps are IPAs but they run the gambit from lagers and blondes all the way to Belgians and seasonal specialties.  There are quite a few handles from local Arizona breweries plus mostly western US beers and a few imports from Michigan, Pennsylvania (Victory Pils) and the UK and Belgium.  I am sure they will be rotating handles through the year, fortunately the full list is available through untapped.  In addition to beers they offer some wines and a Cider from Mesa's Cider Corps.  There is no kitchen so if you get the urge there is the Szechwan Garden next store and across the courtyard is a well respected Thai restaurant.  Location wise it is in a small L-mall strip center on the SW corner of Rural and Ray and the entrance faces Rural.  With takeout from 2 Asian restaurants next store,  you can solve the equations for getting great craft beer and Asia food simultaneously, plus across the street in the Fry's Plaza there is Pokewave which has an excellent array of Poke.",1

It takes 25-30 minutes for the food to be prepared so it's not fast but I think theyre always super busy and they want to make sure the food they serve is fresh and Delicious!

GyAjuDFTsSLLE1v8NdmZ7g,"I am a brand new patient of Family Doctors of Green Valley and I must begin by confessing that I come to this clinic with a bit of a prejudice under my hat against doctors and doctor's offices in general.  In February I started having stomach pains that rapidly went from uncomfortable to debilitating to frightening and the need for a primary care physician arose.  Not having a regular primary care physician, I went to the first medical office that I could recall seeing in my travels around town ... it was a horrible experience.  Then I received a recommendation from my sister to see Dr. Vaquez at Family Doctors of Green Valley.  The first thing that I loved about FDoGV is how pleasant the woman who scheduled my appointment was.  I believe her name was Amy.  She was literally my first impression of this clinic and a very, very good one.  The office hours were another blessing as I've had to completely exhaust all of my paid time off at work to make my previous doctor's visits in other clinics.  Evening appointment options are A GODSEND!  I arrived for my appointment and loved the cleanliness of everything, the polished look that has a subconscious association with sterility which is precisely what one wants from a Dr's office.  At the same time, just enough color and decor to feel comfortable and inviting.  Aside from the stronger lighting and the lack of a whispering fountain, the waiting room feels like a day spa - spotless yet comforting.    Dr. Vazquez further added to the impress.  I cannot begin to tell you how much I loved that there was a nurse present to transcribe my entire visit.  My previous doctor repeatedly confused me with her other patients, made me repeat my symptoms to her, and asked about results for tests she'd never ordered.  None of this happened with Dr. Vazquez because everything I said was being put in writing as I said it.  Dr. V knows his stuff - that became apparent almost immediately, and he LISTENS!  It is SO SO important to have a physician that actually listens!  I finally felt like I was being seen by someone who wanted to diagnose and treat me!  All of the staff was incredibly helpful as well but the most shining example of service and care that I have met to date has to be Ynah and I've not even met her in person yet.  Dr. Vazquez ordered a test that I've never heard of before with a scary sounding name and I felt intimidated but Ynah took charge of the situation as if the appointment were her own.  She went to bat for me and ran the extra mile without hesitation like an olympian!  She took note of my availability and said that she would call me back ... imagine my shock when she called me back just a few hours later!  She'd made an appointment for me with the radiologist after confirming that they were covered by my insurance and, as luck would have it, she has also personally experienced this exact test that I will be having done so she took just a few quick but precious minutes to explain what would be required of me, what the discomfort level of it might be, and what to expect from an overall perspective.  The comfort that this gave me .... beyond words.  I felt like I could trust her and I feel educated now which is great because insufficient information gives me anxiety.  Through multiple calls today to help answer my questions, Ynah has shown patience, compassion, a willingness to help resolve any issue that might arise and to make this entire experience as easy and comfortable for me as it can be.  This will be my primary health care provider from now on and I will be avidly recommending them every chance that I get."
Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw,"I've been to <restaurant>Casanova</restaurant> twice now, once for a big group dinner and once for a quick breakfast, and both times I've been disappointed in the lack of service. It isn't even the fault of the servers, but with the management who seem to have a bad attitude. Most recently we stopped in for breakfast and asked if our vegan friend could bring in a sandwich from Subway. The manager told us that they had their own vegetarian sandwich, but reluctantly let her bring in the Subway since the restaurant was 80% empty at 8 AM on Sunday anyway. Last time, we were left waiting for quite a while despite having reservations. I remember the manager at that time being awful as well!  The food isn't even that great anyway. I remember the <dish>pasta</dish> was alright, but nothing particularly memorable. Definitely pass this place up for breakfast - $15 for <dish>steak and eggs with frozen hash browns</dish>.

GzJwTAtk7nAb5GXipbBj7w,"I loved that I was immediately approached and asked if I need any help. I asked if I could try out a few clubs and the sales associate was very nice about showing me to the hitting bay. He left me for a few minutes to warm up and then walked me through a fitting for the clubs I was looking at. Although the store was busy, he seemed very intent on making sure I had enough time to decide if I liked the clubs I was hitting.   Once I had decided to buy one, I asked if they price matched from their competitors. This is when things got weird. His chipper attitude to help me went down the drain. After discussing it with his manager, they did offer to price match. However, it seemed like such a bother to them to do this. It was a little off-putting to me.   Their selection is top notch. You can find all sorts of clubs. I will definitely be back but I'm hoping next time they are more apt to make a sale even if it means price matching their competitors."

H3gLUOAYxnYL6Rzgvq28Jg,"3 stars for really delicious food. Knocked off 2 stars for awful service. So I've been lurking a few foodie Instagram accounts for awhile, but one that always stuck out to me was <restaurant>Lustucru</restaurant>'s gorgeous presentation. Come MTL à Table event, I was excited to try their menu.  Good : The food. Is. Top. Notch. Wow, everything just tasted so fresh and amazing. Our second waitress was very cordial and friendly, and the food was brought out promptly. The decor is cozy, nice looking spot.  Bad : So I arrived early for <occasion>dinner</occasion> at the restaurant without a reservation and it was pretty empty. A good sign that we will get seats and our food quickly! Well, the hostess informed us that it's full...excuse me? 1/3 occupied seats is not full. She said maybe we can sit at the bar. I was okay with it, but then she had to go speak with someone, make some phone calls, and then confirmed that they had seats available. My boyfriend wanted to get the 3 course MTL a Table menu and I wanted to get some tartares (it looked so good on Instagram...). When we were ready to order, the first waitress insisted that we both have to order off the MTL à Table menu or we both have to order from the regular menu because it's restaurant policy. The reasoning? They have separate kitchens. At a glance, the open kitchens are right next to each other. Then she tells us that the regular menu has the MTL a Table items too and we can order off the regular menu. So with that logic, the second kitchen makes the same items? I was pissed off, what kind of restaurant tells their clients they can't order items from their menu? What the hell is the point of having a menu if you're not even going to give your patrons the choice of what they want to eat? I was ready to leave.   Bottom Line : Go for the food, it's amazing. However, their staff and restaurant policies are a bit off.",1

We hit HJ around 11am because I heard there was some sort of morning rush (starting promptly at 11:30am it was a zoo) and were seated promptly although it took asking 3 servers to finally get a high chair.   Next time in retrospect we'll ask for a table by the wall so that when the kid plays with chopsticks (read: makes giant stabbing motions in the air) he won't skewer the person behind us which he did about 6 times.  The food though was pretty fresh and plentiful - once they figured out that we actually knew a thing or two about dim sum (and that the kid was shoving <dish>har gow</dish> into his trap faster than they could put it on our table) the food was flowing. They even had a few things that I haven't seen passed around at the other dim sum restaurants I've been to recently.   All in all for 4 people and a hungry toddler the bill came out to just under $50 which is pretty good considering how much we ate. Check this place out - and if you see a shumai go whizzing over your head - not gonna lie, that's probably my kid practicing his chopstick ninja moves.",1
H7rpWv02D6WTu6IpNNDkWw,"I was extremely happy when this store opened in the downtown location since most of the stores tend to be in the suburbs where they have the ample space.   With the store being located on the second floor of the Aura building, it was simply massive.  Lots of organized sections with shelves after shelves and containers after containers of merchandise with everything imaginable.  The store definitely has lots of merchandise \beyond\"" just bed and bath items.  I would describe it as organized chaos because the store just has too much of everything that the eyes tend to wander.    Absolutely an eyesore as everything seemed crowded among the spacious floor as if they were trying to fill every available space with merchandise.  Prices are fairly high for most items, but they often have clearances which is worth checking out on a regular basis.  Clearance items are displayed in the middle of the walkway making the aisles look even busier.   To get to checkout, one would have to walk through the maze of merchandise since it's located on the opposite end which is definitely a good way to get customers looking at all their merchandise beyond what they came to shop for.  Although, the checkout experience is often friendly, fast and efficient making the shopping venture worthwhile.  Funny they don't go beyond with their customer service as rarely have I been asked if they can help me find anything since it really is quite like a scavenger hunt in the store.  Hide and seek anyone?  Why can't they have a checkout at the entrance as well? Well, only Customer Service is located there, that's why."""
H8qlBw1YaxMsItfz25-AyA,I personally love John Cutter... Especially the Philly. Prices seem pretty typical for Vegas and I think the atmosphere is great. On one visit I had a waitress that was a bit slow and forgetful but it was also super busy so maybe she was overwhelmed.   Bottom line... I would highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone.,1
H9Vj2fKJia3p6BOrjDaL6A,"Cancel cancel and cancel... These front desk bitches will practically wait the last minute to call and let you know that your appointment has been canceled.

H9WgoLOMS5emyetYD6YVUA,"I'm giving this place 5 stars not for perfection but because I have nothing to complain about.  The owner is a great guy. He is curious how you found the place as at this time it is a lot of word of mouth. Nice backstory on how he got to where he is.  Now for the Pizza! when you hold the slice, it isn't a piece of cardboard like many places.   This has to be a first for me. The dough is what i noticed 1st when I had my first bite. The was light, chewy. it was cooked just right. Cheese tasted good and not over bearing like pizza should. (If that is an issue for you go to PIzza Hut)  The toppings? I can see Pepperoni and all the other toppings I ordered and he did not skimp. Everything was fresh and good. This was an issue I had in a previous review for a Panago location. I ate the crust! I rarely eat pizza crust and the crust was gooood.  Now this is what really surprised me. I ordered the <dish>16\ 5 topping special</dish> for $20. For the size and quality of the food I consider it a bargin.  He loves what he is doing and you can taste it in his food. I will be back for sure.""",1

They do get super busy, but everyone we've worked with has been great!"

HHH_mrl-x694asUCs3SHeQ,"I had a broken crown and did not have a dentist (moved from Ohio), called a few different offices w/o any response. H&B answered and gave me a consult appointment within an hour. The front office staff are very professional and explained the paperwork needed. The Dr. (Dr. Kris) and asst were better than polite, they treated me as if I were a longtime patient and made certain I was apprised of all that was necessary and had the cost explained before any other work was done. There was zero pressure to use their services and explained the high end cost as well as the basic. The fact that they have their own crown making ability on site was a big factor in agreeing to the work. My new permanent crown was done and I was out the door in just over an hour, the cost ended being the low end which was great as they didn't try to upcharge for an unscheduled service. I am glad to say that I have found my family dentist. Well done H&B!"
HHkxD8dHw7vJ5tFWVRnvEw,"The best place in cleveland for all of your waxing needs! I spend less here getting my eyebrows done than Ulta, and it's great quality. The girls who work here are incredibly nice and very detail-oriented, ensuring that they really take care of everything before you walk out of the door. I also just love the music they play! Be sure to visit their site and book an appointment online - hours and days are usually pretty flexible as long as you plan a week in advance."

HM2x8A0ZzCMcIM_1XNhpxw,"I try not to frequent this particular grocery store, even though I grew up right around the corner from it and still live within a few blocks' walk. Maybe it was my youthful ignorance, but I miss Tops. And even Finast. Those were the days. Anyways...  I still stop in now and again to pick up one or two things on my way home from work, or if I need something very specific that I know one of the smaller chains around here isn't likely to have. And every time, I regret it.   I always leave at least mildly annoyed for one reason or another, but my biggest issue is this: WHY DOES THE PARKING LOT/ENTRY AREA ALWAYS SMELL LIKE RAW SEWAGE?!? Like, always. I dare you to go there and find a time when it doesn't smell like 7 people just took a dump in front of the door. Dead of winter, gale force winds - doesn't matter - the stench prevails. And I'm supposed to feel good about buying my food there? Food that I eat? Nah."
HNAH23RNUTTivzhebQTozw,"+1 star, purely based off the fact my boyfriend's <dish>cheesesteak</dish> was the best it has been at this location (which isn't saying much, sadly... but it's something.) -4 stars, for the COMPLETELY ridiculous and extremely subpar customer service. Today was the last straw with this place. My boyfriend called ahead to order. At the time it was said to be ready for pickup, I entered the line for the order pickup drive thru. There was already a car in front of me at the window, and 2 cars followed behind me, so I was essentially boxed in-- which is fine in drive thrus because it's a speedy process, right? WRONG. The man in front of me honked his horn several times within several minutes of waiting, with no answer. He then used his keychain carabiner to knock on the window several times, no answer. I had tried calling the location to let someone know there were people waiting, and no one answered my 4 attempts to reach someone. FINALLY after over 10mins of zero employee interaction, some dirty looking Joe Schmo opens the window, open-mouthed chewing gum, and says to the man in front of me \Yea how can I help ya?\"" Is that a joke? Do you mean how can you help other than doing your job in the first place? He didn't even apologize!  So then it's my turn, and I roll up to the window. I didn't get an apology either, but I guess I didn't expect one at this point. I get the same \""Yea how can I help ya?\"" So I say, \""I'm picking up for an order under the name Andrew.\"" This guy fully sticks his upper body out of the window and says bewilderedly \""YOUR name is Andrew?!\"" First of all, NO! Second of all, WHO CARES WHAT MY NAME IS! Is it your job to pass judgement or is it your job to be a clean, respectful employee that provides at least semi-decent customer service by manning the window and simply handing people their orders? So after he goes to grab the sandwich, he comes back and says \""Well I guess here's your sandwich, ANDREW.\""  I don't get it. Such a simple task. I even understand getting the lunch hour rush (which this wasn't) and getting backed up on orders.  BUT. Not even answering the window, with 4 cars waiting, for over 10mins, and not apologizing to anyone, is uncalled for.   This location is only 2 mins from our house, but we definitely WON'T be returning here. The convenience is not worth the annoyance.""",1

I first tried it about 3 weeks ago, and have come back another 2 times since then.  The gelatos are all homemade and feature very interesting, complimentary flavours. My favourite is the <dish>raspberry lime gelato</dish> (the blue one). The coconut one is also really good, not too sweet and tastes absolutely beautiful with lime juice.   Also had the pleasure of trying the <dish>rotisserie chicken rice</dish>. The chicken is cooked to perfection, a little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I really like the yellow rice and the spicy peanut oil sauce definitely adds a kick to the entire dish. I ordered the Rotisserie Chicken combo which comes with a drink.   The <dish>peach tea</dish> reminded me of an iced tea lemonade from starbucks, with stronger lemonade. It also has peach slices inside and is very pleasant if you enjoy peach, lemonade, and a stronger taste than your usual peach iced tea. I will definitely be ordering this again next time.   The <dish>pho</dish> is also very tasty. Portions are a little smaller than what you'd expect at normal pho places, but the broth is super delicious and makes this dish very worth trying!

The sauce so thick, and muddled with strings of chicken, that it was more the texture of a hummus or a thick spread. Flavour was good, but the sauce needed to be velvety-smooth and creamy! Also, could have used some fresh cilantro. The chicken was stringy, not juicy, and the peppers were enormous and raw. A big portion for $12.95 though. Also disappointed they didnt include any pappadaums, or any cutlery or napkins. The big plus was that it came in 30 minutes, much sooner than the advertised 45-60 minutes, but i wouldn't order here again. A good sauce is just too important.

Hb72oiMn7DmE5Ag5px01Fg,Real Results is the best gym in town. It's not just a gym it's a community. I haven't met one person that's not nice.

The real 90 program gives you the tools you need to lose weight and reach any personal and business goals you've set.  This is the only gym I've joined where I'm actually getting the results I want.

After the entire cleaning, I could instantly smell the difference. So happy to have stumbled upon them. Will refer them and continue using only their services. Attached are before and afters."
HjJp2tI4Xzs7MKyL31E0DA,"I'm sure that most women have had the (terrible) experience of turning around in the salon chair while the stylist says \ta-da!\"" and instantly hating their new hair. Unfortunately, I have had enough bad experiences that I've been able to perfect the transition of a cringe into a fake smile while chirping \""this is exactly what I wanted!\""   NOT the case with Destefino. Truly, every time I leave this salon I turn into a huge narcissist. Veronica does SUCH an amazing job. Not only is her eye for color spot on, she also listens and understands her customers' requests and does what they ask. If I ask her for a trim, it really is just a trim - not two inches off my ends.   I haven't been to many other stylists at this salon but I have heard wonderful things about each of them. No matter who you get, though, when you turn around and say \""this is exactly what I wanted!,\"" it will be authentic."""
HkbNItNrnXlNo59M0YyoMg,"Omg amazing is really all I can say. I'm from out of town and was just walking around and stumbled upon this place. At first glance it looks like a hipster bar that serves frozen burritos, but the moment your food arrives prepare to be amazed. I had the <dish>smothered burrito</dish> and my girl friend had the <dish>chicken fajitas</dish>. Neither of us were able to finish the portions are great. Everything perfectly seasoned. Only thing I was unsure about was the <dish>Coleslaw</dish> but it went perfectly on my burrito. Oh and don't forget about there <dish>cherry limeade cocktail</dish>, just the right amount of sweet and fruity. Pretty sure everytime I come to Pheonix this is going to be a mandatory stop.   The quality of the food is matched by the quality of service you receive, our server was very cheerful and everyone was dressed nice and the restaurant was very clean. If you are in Scottsdale this is a must.",1

Also I purchased several dresses from here that have gotten holey and faded since I've owned them for over a year.   I wish this store would take itself more seriously and not sell clothing that is so cheaply made.  I also don't like being followed around a store like I am stealing!!!  I am not going to shop lift any of your cheaply made garments, so chill."
Ho3ntCl5vBBcR8_2Gf0KfA,I tried to make my daughter an appointment to see the pediatrician. I didn't even make it past the front office girls. They wouldn't accept us as patients because my daughter isn't able to have vaccinations due to an allergic reaction from them.  I guess we will just find another pediatrician that is more understanding.
HojGJ6jqaAy3lir4h4q_zQ,"This is my first and only Yelp review, but I HAVE to share my disturbing experience with this dentist office.  My experience is extremely similar to Michele H.'s below.  After 2 years of putting up with rude and snobby hygienists who coerced me into purchasing a $500 night guard, prescribed me muscle relaxants (which I never filled), and tried to tell me that I was developing gingivitis, my final visit, in December 2013 was an extremely distressing experience.   I was told by the new female dentist that there was some very serious decay going on in almost all of my molars, and if I didn't take a day off of work within the next week to undergo some very expensive procedures, then I would need a root canal in the near future.  She was very rude and condescending and forced me to make an appointment immediately. I requested that the office send my Xrays to my childhood dentist in Michigan, who my family members and I have all been seeing for the last two decades.  They immediately got defensive and questioned why I would want a second opinion.  They eventually agreed to send the Xrays, but they never actually sent them.  Luckily, I ended up cancelling my appointment and never had these procedures done.  I am writing this review 7 months later because today I went and visited my Michigan dentist.  It turns out that there is absolutely nothing wrong with any of my teeth or gums - not one single cavity, and the nightguard was completely unnecessary.  PLEASE no one else go to this corrupt, unprofessional office!  They should be shut down!"

Hr_Bk65xD2yQxjJhhorH1g,I love this zoo!  This is the second time I've been here and its even better since they finished some major renovations.  The polar bear enclosure is really great.  I feel like you get really up close and personal with all the animals here more so than other zoo's.  All the animals also seem very well taken care of.  They have a great play area for kids.  Not to mention it is a free zoo.  That said they do ask for donations.  But I feel its well worth donating.  It's definitely a days worth of fun.

In this area, not sure why a 24 hour store is justified, but we shall see if that works out. The male employee at the register was friendly and gave me coupons that are good in January. No one was in the store when I got there, then a few customers showed up. The store is clean and looks brand spanking new.

I might as well have asked \what do you have to serve today?\""  Took another 20 minutes for food to come out and they didn't clear our appetizer remnants (lime pieces all over the table) before they placed our meals down. My boyfriend had the <dish>shrimp and rice plate</dish> and suffered food poisoning shortly after.   WILL NOT RETURN due to bad service, food, and shortage of food.""",1
HudCKBs3crW5mjaD7Y89gQ,Hosted a girl guides activity here in 2015 and once in 2013 with twelve 5 year old girls. The girls were able to design and decorate their own cookies. It was so much fun! The staff were so attentive and helped the girls with everything from start to finish. Even the leaders had a blast and the coffee wasn't too shabby while we waited!   Unfortunately not a nut free kitchen so we can only do this on years when we do not have members with nut allergies.
Hxf9M7OJVtBGzGMB6e4BVw,"I was in a drunk driving accident last year at the end of June in Arizona. I'm originally from Los Angeles and was traveling to visit family that day. I have never been hit by a drunk driver nor have I had an accident in another state. I wasn't sure how to go about this, to begin with. When I contacted Phillips Law Group, they were the third law firm I had contacted. The paralegal I spoke to first was Bari who answered all my questions and concerns in the most professional and timely manner. She was extremely personable and made me feel very comfortable during our initial call. Shortly after, she left the firm, and my case was reassigned to Cindy who has been such a pleasure to work with. I had severe whiplash and needed medical attention, Cindy always followed up with me to check on my progress and to give me updates on my case. She genuinely showed concerned, not only about my case but also about my personal life. I am a nursing student, and I welcome any support.  We encountered a few delays because it was hard to get in touch with the insurance agents and Cindy always helped and went above and beyond. She made me feel as though I was speaking to a friend who is guiding me through a first time experience. My two attorneys were Jon and Nasser. Both were great to work with and worked very hard to get the most out of my case. All I was concerned about was the medical treatment since I do not have good medical insurance. I received amazing care, and I was overall happy with the outcome and experience working with them. I highly recommend this law firm."
Hxy2JinkHvPDEB12tXJ-qw,I called Car Life for the first time today and they helped me replace a battery that was under warranty free of charge. The owner brought it out himself and he did not try to upsell me but instead told me my options for an upgraded battery which was very helpful information. Although Carlife made $0.00 from me they treated me fairly and provided Grade-A customer service and treated me like a customer instead of a dollar sign.
HykFCJwcTZDjKI2uuv1wCA,"Went in to do a title transfer and get a plate for a motorcycle I just purchased. First off I can clearly see this place is 100 times cleaner than the local mvd. Secondly the customet service here is on another level compared to the mvd as well.   I will never ever ever go into another mvd office in the state of AZ as long as I live unless absolutely necessay.  I wish I remembered the ladies name who helped me I would thank her personally on here. However, everyone behind the counter was constantly smiling and helping out each client in anybway they could.   Keep up the good work and customer service!"
HykZIiaHS35N2c5_QHoClA,Hidden gem but so worth it!! Best service. Haven't been here in years and they still remembered us. Husband and wife owned. They are amazing!

I got their <dish>medium smoked turkey sandwich</dish> on sourdough bread and could hardly finish it; it was pretty big. It was also a pretty good sandwich too. I went at a random, unbusy time so my sandwich was freshly made pretty quickly.  Located in Excalibur's upstairs food court, it was nice to find something not dripping with grease like some of the other fast food places around.",1
HzTn8R01ovIl_UkpR6RdJw,Absolutely ridiculous!! I am a paying member Who signed up at the south rainbow location due to the proximity of my work. Saw there was a West Charleston location which is on my way home. I stopped there to get my car washed and I was informed that they are not excepting the fast pass from the south rainbow location at their's. The explanation was the owner as a 14 days ago did not allow the fast passes to crossover. Blows my mind that a company with only a few locations and so much more competition out there with several locations would make such a business decision. Very disappointing.
I-7JXoyVi-QpZJLbJMDrgg,"The older woman with red hair & gray roots is a horrible representative of this establishment.  She has been the counter worker the last 3 visits and she is always unpleasant and upsetting. There is supposed to be a $6.99 whole pizza special on Mondays per in-store flyer, when we ordered it she told us we have to do carry out to get that price or it is $4.00 more to dine in for the pizza. It does not say this on the sign and it's such a unfriendly policy- there were tons of tables. Last time I order the special in the driveway it took 25 minutes to get my <dish>pizza</dish> & they had me park in the lot to wait.  This time they make it in 10 minutes & demanded we leave.

I02fZsl5otCPP1XRu0y40Q,"Called JPG Security for an estimate to update a 1 month old system which was installed by a company called IntegrationDesign.  Integration did a sloppy job of installing and was a money grubbing company.   Spoke to Jim at JPG and set up an appointment for the same day.  Within 15 minutes of his sales pitch, I knew that I was going with his company.  He treated me like a king, was very knowledgable and a total gentleman.  Today (less than 24 hours,) his installer Nick came to do the installation.  He too, was knowledgeable and personable.  I HIGHLY recommend JPG- do not shop around- just call them.  They are more than fair and reasonably priced.  Thank you Jim and Nick for a job VERY well done."
I2HLOJaQ7EURVY2U4HEMVg,"We checked this place out with some friends back in November. I had a pretty good time. Everyone in our group got a pass that included the laser maze, laser tag, bumper cars, go karts and miniature golf + 2 hours of free game play. We ate at the food truck alley first which was very cool and had some great options. Afterwards we enjoyed the attractions. I have to say the Bumper cars and go karts were my favorite. The laser maze was somewhat of a disappointment.  All in all it was a fun time. My only concern was it was a bit pricey  and the 2 hour game play doesn't even include that many of the games. Plus was that it was not very crowded for a Saturday night-perhaps because of the cost. All in all, I would probably go again."

This place, turned out, to be the only place in Las Vegas to find the shower I was looking for.  They also had a lot of great stuff like reusable camping plate/cup/utensil sets, magnesium flint fire starters, cast iron skillets, and percolators.  They also had a nice selection of sleeping bags with prices comparable to Amazon.  Score!  I'm definitely going to go back to check out their mountaineering and other sports gear.  This place has everything!"

I4EmpNOW7zCcx7fUnQ9ixg,"I love <restaurant>Saigon Kitchen</restaurant>. For a while, we were heading there every weekend. It had just gotten too crazy though with all the snowbirds. I hate driving down Bell rd this time of year. So we havent gone in a while and having been ordering take out from Pholicious.  But that does not mean it isn't good. Its is great. I love the atmosphere. It is more upscale and classy compared to most Vietnamese places. It also has an interesting menu with so many things I want to try. I just can't not order Pho though. It is so tasty and healthy. I feel like a better person when I order pho. The <dish>pho</dish> here is great. It comes out fresh and hot, tons of veggies. My husband gets the pho thair and he loves it.  He actually prefers this place over pho tahn because it is classier. I like the pho better at the other place, but will go to either one. They are both about the same distance from my house. Plus this one has beer and drinks.  The service is always excellent. The staff is very friendly and loves our baby. They always make sure she is comfortable there. My only complaint is that they charge a lot for the small side of rice we give her.   It is fun going to Surprise and seeing all the snow birds trying this place. At first they are a little nervous, and get the simple things on the menu that are familiar. Then I see them looking at my soup. They always ask us what it is and say they are going to order it next time, and they are so happy they decided to try this place even though it was \different\"" and \""not their usual\"". So go on Surprise snowbirds, try Saigon Kitchen, don't be scared, its fresh healthy and delicious. Try the pho!""",1

They told me who would be doing my hair when I made my appointment that day. When I got there, Diana (my student hair dresser), was waiting for me. She took me to her station and talked about what would be good to change up my hair. The instructor was always there to double check before any changes or cuts were made; giving me peace of mind.

IPEQKKR2yozx4-4hjUx13w,"Great course with amazing views. The Mesquite grill, what a spectacular view, beautiful patio with a wonderful fireplace.  Service was great could not have been treated any better, great wine selection and with 1/2 bottles on Saturday nights makes it even better. The menu selection has great verity, I really enjoyed the <dish>Sun Devil Salad</dish> and the <dish>Fish tacos</dish> are wonderful.",1
IPkCm4fkX6ok1ugPQ0ZxDw,"I can hardly believe that I'm actually admitting this, but here it goes...  Before this past weekend I had never been to the main branch of Cleveland Public Library.   That's right, never. I know, it's hurts me to think that with all the time I spend downtown that I've never been to this particular location. Although I've utilized some of the other CPL branches quite frequently, I'm still ashamed!  Well, all that guilt stops here because I'm officially addicted to this amazing Cleveland public resource! My first vision of the CPL was walking around the front. It's separated into two connected buildings, one new and one old. Isn't this just the \Cleveland story\""? It's such an old city full of rich history, but we're slowly updating all while maintaining the integrity of our past. I love that the CPL captures this idea.   I walked around the back of the building and was pleasantly surprised by the gorgeous outdoor atrium! The design was something out of a story book. There were benches and chairs everywhere for you to plop down on, read and relax. At the center of it all was a unique and tranquil fountain with quotes and excerpts from literature.   The interior of the buildings matched the look of the outside quite well. One reminded you of past Cleveland scholars or families who must have spend many of hours here researching and learning. The other was a look into the present day with all the resources you could ever need in a public library, plus more!    Honestly, sometimes I forget what an amazing advantage I have in the CPL. If I need to rent movies (new ones!), books, music, etc., I can do it all for free! Need internet access or time on a computer? This is also free! You can even print off some pages of research. Looking for a book you can't find anywhere else? You'll find it here! If not, they'll contact one of the other Cleveland branches and get it for you. Visit their website and you can order books and even set up email reminders for due dates! This is huge for me because I always forget those pesky dates. Oy, all those fines!  This is an incredible asset for the youth of Cleveland as well. It gives everyone the access to educational material, no matter what your situation may be. Whether you need to study, chill out, get away, do some research or even just have some quiet time, CPL is there for you! Utilize this amazing resource we have in Cleveland!"""
IQJ769ftxu00hi_NkXQfcw,"Great place to eat! You get a lot of food for your money. The waitress and waiters are very nice. The only complaint I have is the ketchup, personally I like Heinz or Hunts ketchup but the ketchup they use is an off brand. I have had a <dish>hotdog</dish> a <dish>burger</dish> and their <dish>fried pickles</dish> which all seemed to be great. I will return in the future!",1
ITIqv6QzRV_tE-PS6Brw6A,"Went back but was disappointed. A day after the dining there both my wife and I felt a bit queasy. We discussed this with friends and they shared the same feeling. We were pleased by the 'highly spiced' offerings, but these probably are applied to less fresh fish. We did not explore how the tepanyaki works.   The day following the second visit....a bit of queasiness........I could be purely coincidental, but......................  I will not return.",1
IU31IE28AnAduEqJ5Gzvkg,"I visited this E<restaurant>instein's</restaurant> location today for a <dish>bagel</dish> and a <dish>coffee</dish> with my boyfriend today. When I walked in I didn't get a greeting or anything, just a cashier staring at me. After staring at each other for about 20 seconds, I guessed that was my queue to order. I was just surprised that I didn't get a hello or a greeting or anything. It was a little weird. Otherwise, my order was correct and tasted good. The cashier was just a little odd and the staff didn't seem to move very fast. I would visit again, but probably not at this location.",1
IUa2BpapER0tFpZDXxLnsA,"If you want to avoid a super long line up, I recommend to go early. I went there at 9:30 and there were 4 persons before my turn. I could get a freshly baked <dish>cheesecake</dish> for $12. It tasted like a typical Japanese cheese cake; fluffy and soft. The size is small but it might be too cheesy to finish it for one person. I recommend to share it with two persons.",1
IVKVk7ZAPdQi6S40UX0zyg,"I've been taking my poodle mix Teddy here since I adopted him in March 2014. They actually did his first groom after I got him from the shelter and he was matted and filthy--they took such good care of him and made him look like a brand new dog. From our first visit, Kathy has remembered Teddy and me. She and her staff are great, friendly and fun. The self wash is the best I've seen and I don't go anywhere else because this place is clean, doesn't smell like wet dog and the quickest and easiest way to give your dog a bath.  We also use their grooming services and I have no complaints. Teddy always looks great and is happy as can be when I pick him up.  Highly recommend this place. Teddy loves the treats, too."
IVkEpFjsUxnlihWeDU6EQw,They have a nice selection of saltwater stuff among other pets. The staff are friendly. Prices are honestly about double the average of other saltwater stores and i've been to many and on constantly online.
IWu1FqePIpLfcdr2GmdBew,Stayed at the Hitchin Post Rv Park and saw the add for Red Rock RV Wash.Called them for pricing and set appointment for the next day. Zack showed up 45 minutes early and introduced himself to me and my wife explained what he was going to do then got started. What a beautiful job he did.He washed the coach cleaned the windows put protectant on the wheels then polished the wheels to a high gloss. Very professional wanted to make sure we were happy.I am very particular about our coach. The job he did was outstanding. Would recommend this company to anyone needing an rv wash or wheels polished if you are in the Las Vegas area. 5STARS
IXBB2vwgTtEWkeB9hdCC1w,"On April 12th, 2017 I purchased 2 policies for my wife and I. These policies were for the Google Pixel XL smartphone and an additional Motorola Droid 2 Android smartphone. The total was $140.93 via debit card. Flash forward to July 4th, my wife accidentally went into the lake with her phone in her pocket.The following Monday I filled out the insurance claim and before I got the label to ship the phone to them to be repaired they made me pay an additional $189 to replace the phone if it was not repairable. I was told if it was repairable they would refund the difference from $189 to $59. (approx $130) I made the $189 payment via debit card and then they sent me a label by email to mail the phone, which I did around July 7-10th 2017. After the company had my wife's phone for more than 3 weeks I got frustrated and unsatisfied with their service, I asked for the phone to be returned and for a full refund. I eventually got the phone back unrepaired however there was not a refund. I asked to cancel my policy and it too was denied (they won't let me cancel my policy).This is all well documented through email with the representative (Sean Henson). After multiple attempts I could not get anyone to answer their phone. Thinking I had been ripped off, I decided to dispute the charge with my bank. However after Sean Henson let me know to read my contract I saw that they would send me to collections if I disputed the charge, so I called the bank and told them I no longer wished to dispute it. Still to this day they have me labeled as disputing the charge even though I ultimately decided not to dispute the charge with my bank. I do have proof that I declined to dispute the charge with my bank.The last contact I have had with them was August 15th 2017.   I have been left without my $338 to this day."
IZI9PtYy-zqi6cHYiQOxKw,"<restaurant>Jubilations</restaurant> deserves a star upgrade because of the time and consideration taken to provide some outstanding customer service.  I was treated to a night at Jubilations this week by a client of mine and she has significant dietary restrictions for medical reasons.  A week prior to our reservation, the chef called my client to discuss her needs.  She must have a liquid diet and told the chef to use her imagination.  The night of our reservation, we received top notch treatment.  Our server noted that we were exceptional guests and she would do her best to cater to my client's needs, which she did.    For those who are familiar with the meal protocol, you know you are served soup, salad, the main course and desert.  The chef tried to emulate the standard meal options for my client via blended items and also made a solid effort to create a respectable presentation.  My client was served soup broth, then blended fruit with a hint of cayenne to replace the salad as starters.  Her main course consisted of three separate hot, blended servings presented in a variety of glasses.  One was pureed carrots, another pureed potatoes and the third was some sort of spicy tomato soup.  Desert was this awesome looking <dish>mocha milkshake</dish> with a mint leaf.  My client was absolutely beaming with gratitude and we certainly felt exclusive.  I know she doesn't receive treatment like this very often so this evening was very special for her and I was so thrilled to be there.  The staff truly were amazing.  I must add that the food was better than I remember or maybe there have been improvements.  The <dish>carrot cake</dish> was in fact the best I've ever had.  I was skeptical about how much I'd enjoy the show, as it wouldn't have been my choice.  However, within 20 minutes I was sold and by the end, I thought the show was fantastic, as every show I've seen in the past.",1
